<section id="what-llm.c-is" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-llm.c-is">1. What <em>llm.c</em> Is</h3>
<p>Imagine you wanted to peek inside a modern AI model-not by reading thousands of lines of optimized C++ or CUDA hidden inside a giant framework, but by opening a small, neat folder and seeing the entire training pipeline laid out in front of you. That is what <em>llm.c</em> gives you.</p>
<p>At its heart, <em>llm.c</em> is a reference implementation of how to train and run a GPT-2 style language model, written in pure C (and CUDA). The key word is <em>reference</em>: the code is meant to be minimal, readable, and educational. You don’t need to wade through abstraction layers or device-specific macros. Instead, you get a version that looks almost like pseudocode, but still compiles and runs on your computer.</p>
<section id="why-this-project-exists" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-project-exists">Why This Project Exists</h4>
<p>Deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow are amazing for getting models to work quickly, but they hide most of the actual mechanics. Under the hood, there’s a lot happening: tensors are allocated in memory, gradients are computed through backpropagation, optimizer states are updated, and schedulers adjust the learning rate. Most of us never see those details, because the framework handles them for us.</p>
<p><em>llm.c</em> flips this around. It says: <em>what if we removed the black box and showed you exactly how a GPT-2 model is trained, line by line?</em> It’s not about speed or production deployment. It’s about clarity, education, and demystifying how large language models work.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-characteristics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-characteristics">Key Characteristics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minimalism: The CPU version (<code>train_gpt2.c</code>) avoids complicated optimizations so that beginners can follow the logic. Even the CUDA version tries to stay simple, with only necessary calls to cuBLAS/cuDNN.</li>
<li>Self-contained: No external frameworks. The code defines its own tokenizer, dataloader, optimizer, and scheduler. Everything you need is in the repository.</li>
<li>Parallels to PyTorch: Each function in the C/CUDA implementation has a counterpart in PyTorch. The repo even ships with Python test files to prove that the outputs match within tolerance.</li>
<li>Step-by-step scalability: You can start with a tiny model on CPU and, once you understand the basics, switch to GPU, multi-GPU, or even multi-node training. The structure remains the same, just faster.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-you-can-do-with-it" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-can-do-with-it">What You Can Do With It</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Train GPT-2 from scratch: Start with a small dataset (like Tiny Shakespeare) and see the model learn patterns in language.</li>
<li>Experiment with configurations: Change number of layers, sequence length, or hidden size, then watch how memory and training time scale.</li>
<li>Learn GPU training internals: Move from CPU to CUDA, and later to multi-GPU with MPI/NCCL, to see how real distributed training works under the hood.</li>
<li>Profile performance: The repo includes profiling tools so you can measure FLOPs, memory bandwidth, and kernel execution times.</li>
<li>Reproduce big models: With enough hardware, you can actually retrain GPT-2 124M or larger versions, using the exact same setup described in the README.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="why-you-should-care" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-you-should-care">Why You Should Care</h4>
<p>If you’ve ever used a large language model and thought <em>“this feels like magic”</em>, <em>llm.c</em> is your chance to peel back the curtain. You’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>How text is converted into numbers (tokenization).</li>
<li>How those numbers are fed into matrices and transformed.</li>
<li>How attention actually looks in code.</li>
<li>How gradients are computed and weights updated.</li>
<li>How scaling from one GPU to many is managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not magic anymore-it’s math plus code you can read.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-big-picture" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h4>
<p>Think of <em>llm.c</em> as a teaching lab for modern AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>On day one, you can run a small demo on CPU and see loss values dropping as the model learns.</li>
<li>On day ten, you might be profiling CUDA kernels or debugging NCCL synchronization across GPUs.</li>
<li>At every step, the code remains approachable because it avoids unnecessary complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This philosophy makes <em>llm.c</em> unique: it’s not trying to be the fastest or the most feature-rich. It’s trying to be the clearest window into how large language models actually work when stripped down to their essentials.</p>
<p>The Takeaway: <em>llm.c</em> is a minimal, transparent re-implementation of GPT-2 training and inference, designed to teach you how language models operate under the hood. It’s not about production performance-it’s about giving you a guided tour through the machinery of modern AI, one C file at a time.</p>
<p>Would you like me to now expand Section 2 (“Repository Tour”) in the same friendly beginner tone, showing what’s inside each folder and file?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="repository-tour" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repository-tour">2. Repository Tour</h3>
<p>When you first open the <em>llm.c</em> repository, it may look like a random collection of <code>.c</code>, <code>.cu</code>, <code>.py</code>, and shell scripts. But there’s a clear structure hiding underneath. Each part has a purpose, and once you know where things live, navigating the repo feels natural. Let’s take a guided walk through the main pieces.</p>
<section id="root-directory-the-entry-points" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="root-directory-the-entry-points">Root Directory: The Entry Points</h4>
<p>At the top level, you’ll find the core training programs. These are the files you actually compile and run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>train_gpt2.c</code> - The CPU reference implementation. This is the simplest, most readable version of GPT-2 training. It avoids special optimizations so you can follow the math and logic step by step.</li>
<li><code>train_gpt2.cu</code> - The CUDA implementation. Faster, uses GPU kernels, cuBLAS, and optional cuDNN FlashAttention. This is the version you’d use for serious training runs.</li>
<li><code>train_gpt2_fp32.cu</code> - A legacy CUDA path, using plain FP32 precision instead of mixed precision. It’s slower but useful as a debugging baseline.</li>
<li><code>train_gpt2.py</code> - The PyTorch reference. This is the oracle: a tiny script in Python/PyTorch that trains the same GPT-2 so you can compare outputs and verify correctness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important root-level files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Makefile</code> - Defines how to build different versions. Targets like <code>make train_gpt2</code> or <code>make train_gpt2cu</code> are your entry points.</li>
<li><code>README.md</code> - The main guide for running experiments, installing dependencies, and reproducing models.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="llmc-directory-utilities-and-building-blocks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="llmc-directory-utilities-and-building-blocks"><code>llmc/</code> Directory: Utilities and Building Blocks</h4>
<p>This folder holds reusable C utilities that the main training files include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utils.h</code> - Safety wrappers (<code>fopenCheck</code>, <code>mallocCheck</code>) and helper functions.</li>
<li><code>tokenizer.h</code> - Implements GPT-2’s tokenizer in C: encoding text into token IDs and decoding back to text.</li>
<li><code>dataloader.h</code> - Defines how training batches are loaded and served, handling dataset splits and iteration.</li>
<li><code>rand.h</code> - Random number utilities, mirroring PyTorch’s <code>manual_seed</code> and normal distributions.</li>
<li><code>schedulers.h</code> - Learning rate scheduling, like cosine decay with warmup.</li>
<li><code>sampler.h</code> - Implements softmax sampling for text generation and helper RNG.</li>
<li><code>logger.h</code> - Minimal logging functionality for tracking progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of <code>llmc/</code> as the library that keeps the main files clean and readable. Instead of cluttering <code>train_gpt2.c</code> with helpers, everything is modularized here.</p>
</section>
<section id="dev-directory-scripts-and-extras" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dev-directory-scripts-and-extras"><code>dev/</code> Directory: Scripts and Extras</h4>
<p>This folder is full of supporting tools that make experiments easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dev/download_starter_pack.sh</code> - Fetches the GPT-2 124M weights, tokenizer, and datasets. This is the quickest way to get started.</li>
<li><code>dev/data/</code> - Contains scripts for preparing datasets like Tiny Shakespeare or OpenWebText in the binary format that <em>llm.c</em> expects.</li>
<li><code>dev/cuda/</code> - A place for experimenting with standalone CUDA kernels. This is where you’d go if you want to tinker with custom GPU code beyond the main trainer.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="doc-directory-learning-resources" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doc-directory-learning-resources"><code>doc/</code> Directory: Learning Resources</h4>
<p>Documentation that digs deeper into specific topics. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>doc/layernorm/layernorm.md</code> - A tutorial-style explanation of Layer Normalization, complete with math and code. It helps you understand one of GPT-2’s core components before diving into the C implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This folder is a learning aid. Whenever a concept feels too dense, check here for a more gentle walkthrough.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-files" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-files">Test Files</h4>
<p>Testing is taken seriously in <em>llm.c</em>, because the goal is to prove that the C/CUDA implementation is correct compared to PyTorch:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>test_gpt2.c</code> - Runs forward passes and training steps on CPU and compares outputs to PyTorch.</li>
<li><code>test_gpt2cu.cu</code> - Same idea but for CUDA, including both FP32 and mixed-precision runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These files keep everything honest: you can always verify that your build produces the same results as the canonical PyTorch model.</p>
</section>
<section id="profiling-tools" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="profiling-tools">Profiling Tools</h4>
<p>For performance deep dives:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>profile_gpt2.cu</code> - A CUDA profiling harness that benchmarks kernels and measures throughput.</li>
<li><code>profile_gpt2cu.py</code> - Python-side profiler for analyzing GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and FLOPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re curious about where time is being spent in training, these files show you how to measure it.</p>
</section>
<section id="datasets-and-artifacts" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="datasets-and-artifacts">Datasets and Artifacts</h4>
<p>When you run <code>download_starter_pack.sh</code>, you’ll get:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code> - GPT-2’s byte-pair encoding tokenizer, serialized in binary.</li>
<li>Dataset <code>.bin</code> files - Training and validation sets, tokenized and ready for the dataloader.</li>
</ul>
<p>These files are not in the repo by default but are downloaded or generated locally.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-together" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-together">Putting It Together</h4>
<p>The repository is structured like a teaching lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root files are the main experiments.</li>
<li><code>llmc/</code> is the library of building blocks.</li>
<li><code>dev/</code> provides extra tools and scripts.</li>
<li><code>doc/</code> explains tricky concepts in tutorial form.</li>
<li>Tests and profilers make sure everything matches PyTorch and runs efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you see the pattern, the repo feels less intimidating. Every file has a role in telling the story of how a GPT-2 model is built from scratch in C and CUDA.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="makefile-targets-flags" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="makefile-targets-flags">3. Makefile Targets &amp; Flags</h3>
<p>Every C or CUDA program needs a build system, and in <em>llm.c</em> that role is handled by a simple but powerful Makefile. If you’ve never used <code>make</code> before, think of it as a recipe book: you type <code>make &lt;target&gt;</code> in your terminal, and it follows the instructions for compiling the code into an executable. In <em>llm.c</em>, this file is your control center for choosing which trainer to build, whether to enable GPUs, and which optional features to turn on.</p>

<p>Instead of memorizing long <code>gcc</code> or <code>nvcc</code> compile commands with dozens of flags, the Makefile captures those instructions once and gives them a short name. For example, building the CPU trainer is as easy as:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> train_gpt2</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, this calls <code>gcc</code>, sets optimization flags, includes the right headers, and links everything together. The same applies to CUDA builds with <code>nvcc</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="core-targets" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-targets">Core Targets</h4>
<p>Here are the most important build targets you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>train_gpt2</code> - Builds the CPU-only reference trainer. Uses <code>gcc</code> (or <code>clang</code>) and links against OpenMP for parallel loops.</li>
<li><code>train_gpt2cu</code> - Builds the CUDA trainer with mixed precision and optional cuDNN FlashAttention. Uses <code>nvcc</code>.</li>
<li><code>train_gpt2_fp32</code> - Builds the legacy CUDA trainer that stays in pure FP32 (slower but simpler).</li>
<li><code>test_gpt2</code> - Compiles the CPU test program to compare results against PyTorch.</li>
<li><code>test_gpt2cu</code> - Compiles the CUDA test program to check GPU parity with PyTorch.</li>
<li><code>profile_gpt2.cu</code> - Compiles the CUDA profiler harness, used to benchmark kernels and FLOPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these produces a binary you can run directly, for example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./train_gpt2</span></span>

</section>
<section id="key-flags-you-can-toggle" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-flags-you-can-toggle">Key Flags You Can Toggle</h4>
<p>The Makefile also exposes several switches that let you customize the build. You set them when running <code>make</code>, like this:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> train_gpt2cu USE_CUDNN=1</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>Here are the most important flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>USE_CUDNN</code> - Enables cuDNN FlashAttention if your system has cuDNN installed. This can give big speedups for attention, but it’s optional. By default, it’s off.</li>
<li><code>OMP=1</code> - Tells the CPU trainer to compile with OpenMP enabled. This allows multithreaded execution, making CPU runs much faster. Usually on by default if OpenMP is detected.</li>
<li><code>DEBUG=1</code> - Compiles with debugging symbols (<code>-g</code>) instead of maximum optimization. Useful when stepping through code in an IDE or using a debugger.</li>
<li><code>PROFILE=1</code> - Adds profiling hooks, helping you analyze execution time and performance.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="optimization-choices" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimization-choices">Optimization Choices</h4>
<p>The default build uses <code>-O3</code> optimization, which makes the code run fast but sometimes harder to debug. If you’re just learning and want clarity, you can switch to:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> train_gpt2 DEBUG=1</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This creates a binary that runs slower but lets you step through line by line in a debugger. For performance benchmarking, stick with the optimized default.</p>
</section>
<section id="multi-gpu-and-mpi-support" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multi-gpu-and-mpi-support">Multi-GPU and MPI Support</h4>
<p>When building the CUDA trainer, the Makefile can also link against MPI and NCCL if they’re installed. That’s what enables multi-GPU and multi-node training. You usually don’t need to change anything-the Makefile automatically detects these libraries and includes them if available.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-all-together" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h4>
<p>Think of the Makefile as a switchboard for the whole project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to run the simple CPU demo? → <code>make train_gpt2</code></li>
<li>Want to train faster on GPU? → <code>make train_gpt2cu</code></li>
<li>Want to debug kernels? → <code>make train_gpt2cu DEBUG=1</code></li>
<li>Want to test parity with PyTorch? → <code>make test_gpt2</code> or <code>make test_gpt2cu</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With just a few keystrokes, you control whether you’re running a beginner-friendly CPU demo, a high-performance GPU build, or a debugging session.</p>
<p>The takeaway: The Makefile is your control center. It abstracts away complicated compiler commands and gives you a clean menu of options: CPU vs GPU, FP32 vs mixed precision, debug vs optimized, and single vs multi-GPU. Mastering it is the first step to feeling comfortable experimenting inside <em>llm.c</em>.</p>

<p>The simplest way to begin exploring <em>llm.c</em> is with the CPU-only reference implementation. This file, <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, is deliberately designed to be minimal, readable, and approachable. It doesn’t hide complexity behind libraries or macros. Instead, it shows you exactly how a GPT-2 model is trained, step by step, using plain C and a sprinkle of OpenMP for speed.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-start-with-cpu">Why Start with CPU?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clarity first: GPUs add layers of complexity (CUDA kernels, memory transfers, cuBLAS). On CPU, you can focus on the core algorithm without distraction.</li>
<li>Portability: Any machine with a C compiler can run it-no special hardware required.</li>
<li>Debuggability: Errors are easier to trace, and you can single-step through the code in an IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPU version is slower, but that’s a feature here-it forces you to really see what’s happening under the hood.</p>

<p>On CPU, don’t expect speed. Training GPT-2 124M can take days or weeks. But that’s not the point. The CPU reference path is like a glass box: everything is visible, no shortcuts. You’ll use this to learn the mechanics and to verify that your GPU runs match the same results.</p>
<p>If you want to speed things up slightly, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increase OpenMP threads:</p>

<p>Once you’re comfortable with how training looks on CPU-loss values going down, checkpoints being written, logs appearing-you’ll be ready to graduate to the GPU version (<code>train_gpt2.cu</code>). That’s where performance and scaling come in, but the CPU run gives you the conceptual foundation.</p>
<p>The takeaway: Running <code>train_gpt2.c</code> is your first hands-on encounter with GPT-2 training in <em>llm.c</em>. It’s slow, transparent, and designed for learning. You’ll see every piece of the model at work, one step at a time, before diving into the complexity of CUDA.</p>

<p>Once you’ve seen the CPU trainer in action, the natural next step is to try training on a GPU. The file <code>train_gpt2_fp32.cu</code> is the simplest GPU entry point. It predates the more advanced mixed-precision trainer (<code>train_gpt2.cu</code>), and it runs everything in full 32-bit floating point (FP32) precision. That makes it easier to follow and debug, even though it’s slower than modern approaches. Think of it as the “training wheels” for GPU training in <em>llm.c</em>.</p>
<section id="why-this-path-exists" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-path-exists">Why This Path Exists</h4>
<p>Modern GPU training almost always uses mixed precision (FP16/BF16 for speed and memory savings, FP32 for stability). But mixed precision introduces extra complexity: scaling losses, maintaining master weights, checking for overflows. For beginners, all that can be distracting.</p>
<p>The FP32 path avoids those complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every tensor (activations, weights, gradients) is stored as 32-bit floats.</li>
<li>No special handling of loss scaling is needed.</li>
<li>Debugging mismatches with PyTorch is straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trade-off is performance-this version runs significantly slower and uses more memory.</p>

<p>If CUDA is installed correctly, the program will detect your GPU and start training. You’ll see logs that look similar to the CPU trainer’s, but with much shorter step times. For example, a training step that took ~2 seconds on CPU might take ~50 milliseconds on GPU.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Tensors are allocated in GPU memory (not system RAM).</li>
<li>Matrix multiplications (the core of attention and MLP layers) are executed by cuBLAS, NVIDIA’s high-performance linear algebra library.</li>
<li>Kernels for elementwise operations (like adding residuals, applying softmax, or normalizing) are written in CUDA or use built-in primitives.</li>
<li>Gradients and optimizer states are updated entirely on the device, with minimal CPU↔︎GPU transfers.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes training dramatically faster, but the structure of the code is still recognizable compared to the CPU version.</p>

<li>You want a clean comparison with the CPU trainer.</li>
<li>You’re debugging correctness issues without worrying about loss scaling.</li>

<ul>
<li>You want real performance (2–4× faster training).</li>
<li>You’re training larger models (774M, 1.6B parameters) where memory efficiency matters.</li>

<p>The FP32 trainer is like a bridge:</p>
<ul>
<li>On one side is the CPU reference path, slow but crystal-clear.</li>
<li>On the other is the mixed-precision CUDA path, fast but more complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>By walking across this bridge, you learn how GPU acceleration works without being overwhelmed by optimizations.</p>
<p>The takeaway: <code>train_gpt2_fp32.cu</code> is your first taste of real GPU training in <em>llm.c</em>. It skips advanced tricks and shows you a clean, one-GPU, full-precision implementation. It’s not the fastest, but it’s the friendliest way to understand how training moves from CPU to GPU.</p>

<li>Loss scaling: multiply the loss before backward to avoid underflow; unscale the grads before the optimizer step.</li>
<li>Autocast-like behavior: the code picks safe dtypes for each op (GEMMs in tensor cores, reductions in FP32, etc.).</li>

<p>Before you can actually train or test a model in <em>llm.c</em>, you need a few essential artifacts: the tokenizer, a dataset, and a config. These files aren’t stored in the repo directly (they’re too large and often under different licenses), so the project provides scripts to fetch or generate them. This is where the <code>dev/</code> folder comes into play.</p>
<section id="the-starter-pack-script" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-starter-pack-script">The Starter Pack Script</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get going is with:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./dev/download_starter_pack.sh</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This script pulls down a ready-made bundle containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code> - The GPT-2 byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer in binary format.</li>
<li><code>train.bin</code> / <code>val.bin</code> - Pre-tokenized training and validation datasets, often based on OpenWebText or Tiny Shakespeare for demos.</li>
<li>Model configs - A JSON or header file that sets hyperparameters like layers, hidden size, and number of heads for GPT-2 124M.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of this as your “starter kit”: it contains just enough to run a demo and see training loss decreasing without setting up a full-scale dataset pipeline yourself.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-tokenizer-file-gpt2_tokenizer.bin" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-tokenizer-file-gpt2_tokenizer.bin">The Tokenizer File (<code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>)</h4>
<p>This is a binary representation of GPT-2’s tokenizer vocabulary. It maps raw text (like <code>"Hello world"</code>) into integer token IDs, which are the actual inputs to the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why binary? It’s faster to load in C than parsing a text-based vocabulary.</li>
<li>Size? ~500 KB, representing ~50,000 tokens.</li>
<li>Role in training? Used in both the dataloader (to prepare inputs) and the sampler (to decode outputs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Without this file, the model can’t understand text at all-it would just be manipulating meaningless numbers.</p>
</section>
<section id="dataset-files-train.bin-val.bin" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset-files-train.bin-val.bin">Dataset Files (<code>train.bin</code>, <code>val.bin</code>)</h4>
<p>Each dataset file is a binary blob containing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A header (about 1 KB) describing sequence length, vocab size, and other metadata.</li>
<li>A stream of token IDs (<code>uint16</code>), representing the text corpus already tokenized.</li>
</ol>
<p>This design means the C dataloader can simply <code>fread()</code> chunks of tokens into memory, without needing to tokenize text on the fly. It’s fast and memory-efficient, perfect for a lean project like <em>llm.c</em>.</p>
<p>The script usually fetches two versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training set (<code>train.bin</code>)</li>
<li>Validation set (<code>val.bin</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>That way, the training loop can occasionally switch to validation mode and report a validation loss, helping you track overfitting.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-devdata-folder" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-devdata-folder">The <code>dev/data/</code> Folder</h4>
<p>If you want to generate your own datasets, this is where you’ll find the tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripts for Tiny Shakespeare, OpenWebText, or other corpora.</li>
<li>Utilities to tokenize text using the GPT-2 tokenizer and write out the <code>.bin</code> format.</li>
<li>Small Python snippets to check dataset statistics (like number of tokens or average sequence length).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you wanted to try fine-tuning GPT-2 on your own text files, you’d:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run a preprocessing script in <code>dev/data/</code> to tokenize and save your corpus.</li>
<li>Point <code>train_gpt2.c</code> or <code>train_gpt2.cu</code> to your new <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>.</li>
<li>Kick off training as usual.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="why-preprocessing-matters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-preprocessing-matters">Why Preprocessing Matters</h4>
<p>Tokenization and dataset preparation can be surprisingly heavy in Python, especially for large corpora. By precomputing everything into compact <code>.bin</code> files, <em>llm.c</em> keeps the runtime training loop as simple as possible-just reading arrays of integers and feeding them into the model.</p>
<p>This separation of concerns (preprocessing vs.&nbsp;training) is what makes the training code clean and focused.</p>
</section>
<section id="quick-sanity-check" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-sanity-check">Quick Sanity Check</h4>
<p>After running <code>download_starter_pack.sh</code>, you should see these files in your working directory:</p>
<pre><code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin
train.bin
val.bin</code></pre>
<p>If any are missing, re-run the script. Without them, the trainer will exit with a file-not-found error.</p>
<p>The takeaway: The starter pack is your ticket to running <em>llm.c</em> right away. It gives you a tokenizer and datasets in exactly the format the C code expects. Later, when you’re ready to train on your own text or scale up, the <code>dev/data/</code> folder shows you how to prepare custom datasets the same way.</p>

<p>Even though <em>llm.c</em> is designed to be small and readable, training a transformer model is still a big program with lots of moving parts. When something goes wrong-whether it’s a segmentation fault, <code>NaN</code> losses, or unexpected results-you’ll want to be able to debug effectively. That’s where debug builds and IDE stepping come in.</p>
<section id="why-debug-mode-exists" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-debug-mode-exists">Why Debug Mode Exists</h4>
<p>By default, the Makefile compiles with heavy optimization (<code>-O3</code>). That makes the code run fast, but it also makes debugging harder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables may be optimized away.</li>
<li>Functions might get inlined so you can’t step through them clearly.</li>
<li>The debugger may jump around unpredictably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding the <code>-g</code> flag (enabled with <code>DEBUG=1</code>) tells the compiler to include extra information in the binary so you can see exactly what the code is doing at runtime.</p>

<p>When debugging, it helps to add extra logging. The repo already has a lightweight logger, but you can also sprinkle <code>printf</code>s (on CPU) or <code>cudaDeviceSynchronize(); printf(...)</code> (on GPU) to track values. For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>printf<span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"Step </span><span class="sc">%d</span><span class="st">: loss=</span><span class="sc">%f\n</span><span class="st">"</span><span class="op">,</span> step<span class="op">,</span> loss<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>

<section id="best-practices-for-beginners" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-practices-for-beginners">Best Practices for Beginners</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start with the CPU build when learning-it’s easier to debug than CUDA.</li>
<li>Always keep a small dataset (like Tiny Shakespeare) for fast iteration.</li>
<li>Compare against the PyTorch reference for the same batch to catch subtle errors.</li>
<li>Use <code>DEBUG=1</code> whenever you hit strange behavior-you’ll trade speed for clarity, which is usually worth it when learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway: Debug builds (<code>-g</code>) turn <em>llm.c</em> from a black box into a step-through learning tool. With gdb, lldb, or an IDE, you can pause at any line, inspect variables, and understand exactly how GPT-2 training works inside C or CUDA. It’s slower, but it’s the clearest way to learn and fix issues.</p>

<p>The <em>llm.c</em> project isn’t trying to be the fastest or most feature-rich GPT-2 trainer. Instead, it has a very deliberate set of constraints-rules the author imposes on the codebase to keep it approachable and educational. You can think of these as the “contract” between the code and the reader: certain things are kept simple on purpose, even if they cost some performance.</p>
<section id="minimalism-over-optimizations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimalism-over-optimizations">Minimalism over Optimizations</h4>
<ul>
<li>No processor-specific intrinsics: You won’t see AVX, NEON, or other hardware-tuned assembly calls in the CPU path.</li>
<li>No fancy template metaprogramming: Unlike in C++ frameworks, here you get plain C structs and functions.</li>
<li>No exotic libraries: Aside from cuBLAS/cuDNN for GPU acceleration, most functionality is implemented directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the code runs almost anywhere, and you don’t need to understand deep compiler tricks to follow what’s going on.</p>
</section>
<section id="transparency-over-abstraction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparency-over-abstraction">Transparency over Abstraction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every operation is visible in the source. For example, instead of calling a framework function like <code>nn.CrossEntropyLoss</code>, you’ll find an explicit forward and backward pass coded in C.</li>
<li>Data loading, tokenization, optimizer steps, and schedulers are all implemented as separate, small modules in <code>llmc/</code>.</li>
<li>You don’t need to guess what’s happening-if you’re curious, you can open the corresponding <code>.h</code> file and see the exact code.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-where-it-matters-but-no-more">Performance Where It Matters (but No More)</h4>
<ul>
<li>OpenMP pragmas are allowed in CPU builds, because they give large speedups with minimal extra code.</li>
<li>cuBLAS/cuDNN are used for GPU matmuls and attention, because re-implementing them would be a distraction and would make the project impossibly large.</li>
<li>But the project avoids unnecessary complexity-no kernel fusion, no elaborate caching layers, no half-implemented “framework” abstractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This balance ensures you can still run experiments at a reasonable speed, but the code never sacrifices readability.</p>

<li>Variable names are descriptive, not cryptic.</li>
<li>Comments explain not just <em>what</em> happens, but also <em>why</em>.</li>
<li>Files are kept small and focused, rather than sprawling across dozens of layers of abstraction.</li>

<li>Only GPT-2 architectures are covered-don’t expect GPT-3 or transformer variants.</li>
<li>Features like dataset streaming, checkpoint sharding, or advanced distributed tricks are intentionally left out.</li>

<section id="why-this-matters-for-you" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters-for-you">Why This Matters for You</h4>
<p>If you’re learning how transformers work, this contract is a gift:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won’t get lost in performance hacks.</li>
<li>You won’t fight through an abstraction jungle.</li>
<li>You’ll always know that what you’re reading is close to the “pure” algorithmic idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side, if you’re aiming for production-grade speed, you’ll need to layer more on top. But that’s outside the mission of <em>llm.c</em>.</p>
<p>The takeaway: <em>llm.c</em> is bound by a readability contract: clarity over raw speed, transparency over abstraction, minimalism over complexity. These constraints keep the project small enough to fit in your head, while still powerful enough to reproduce GPT-2 training. It’s a teaching lab, not a racing car-and that’s exactly why it’s valuable.</p>

<li>Reports on multi-GPU and MPI runs, including troubleshooting NCCL hangs and performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Debates on mixed precision vs FP32 vs BF16 stability.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h4>
<p>Code alone is not enough. The community context, the discussions, and the learning path make <em>llm.c</em> a living project. By engaging with them, you avoid the feeling of learning in isolation. You’ll see others wrestling with the same challenges, and you’ll have a clearer sense of what to try next.</p>
<p>The takeaway: Beyond the files and scripts, <em>llm.c</em> is a community-driven learning environment. GitHub issues, discussions, reference docs, and external tutorials all form part of the “extended classroom.” If the code is the lab bench, the community is the set of lab partners who help you figure things out along the way.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gpt-2-tokenizer-artifacts-gpt2_tokenizer.bin">11. GPT-2 Tokenizer Artifacts (<code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>)</h3>
<p>A language model like GPT-2 doesn’t directly understand English, Vietnamese, or any other natural language. Instead, it understands numbers. These numbers are called tokens. A tokenizer is the tool that translates between human text and tokens. In <em>llm.c</em>, the GPT-2 tokenizer is stored in a small file called <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>. This file is the key that lets the model read input text and produce output text that we can understand.</p>
<section id="what-this-file-contains" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-file-contains">What This File Contains</h4>
<p>The file <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code> is a binary version of GPT-2’s tokenizer. It includes:</p>

<p>Instead of being written as JSON or text, the tokenizer is stored in binary form. This allows <em>llm.c</em> to load it very quickly using a simple file read, which keeps the code clean and fast.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-it-comes-from">Where It Comes From</h4>
<p>You don’t need to build this file by hand. The repository provides a script to download it, along with small training and validation datasets:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./dev/download_starter_pack.sh</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>After running the script, you should see <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>, <code>train.bin</code>, and <code>val.bin</code> in your working directory. If the tokenizer is missing, the program cannot run because it won’t know how to interpret text.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-code-uses-it" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-the-code-uses-it">How the Code Uses It</h4>
<p>During training, the tokenizer is not active because the datasets (<code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>) are already pre-tokenized into integers. This keeps the training loop fast and simple.</p>
<p>During sampling or evaluation, the tokenizer becomes important again. After the model predicts a sequence of token IDs, the tokenizer translates those numbers back into text that you can read on your screen.</p>
<p>The C API for the tokenizer, defined in <code>llmc/tokenizer.h</code>, provides just three main functions:</p>

<section id="why-it-matters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>Without the tokenizer, the model cannot communicate. The tokenizer is like a shared dictionary between humans and the neural network. If you give the model text, the tokenizer converts it into numbers the model understands. When the model responds, the tokenizer converts its numbers back into text. If the tokenizer does not match the dataset, the model’s predictions will come out as gibberish. Keeping the tokenizer and dataset in sync is essential for correct training and evaluation.</p>
</section>
<section id="try-it-yourself" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="try-it-yourself">Try It Yourself</h4>
<p>Here are a few small exercises you can do to understand the tokenizer better:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check that the file exists: After running the starter pack script, verify that <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code> is in your directory. Try running the trainer without it and observe the error message.</li>
<li>Inspect vocab size: Run the trainer and look for the line that prints <code>vocab_size: 50257</code>. Compare this with <code>padded_vocab_size: 50304</code>. Why do you think padding helps GPUs?</li>
<li>Decode a sequence manually: Write a short C program that loads the tokenizer and decodes a fixed list of token IDs (for example <code>[464, 3290, 318]</code>). Observe what text you get.</li>
<li>Mismatch experiment: If you build your own dataset with a different tokenizer (say, a custom vocabulary), try decoding it with <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>. Notice how the output becomes meaningless, showing why consistency matters.</li>
<li>Dataset + tokenizer link: Open <code>train.bin</code> in a hex viewer. You’ll see it’s just numbers. Use the tokenizer to decode the first few hundred tokens and see real text emerge.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="the-takeaway" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h4>
<p><code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code> is a tiny but vital file. It is the bridge that allows the model and humans to speak the same language. Training is efficient because all data is pre-tokenized, and when you want to see what the model has written, the tokenizer turns raw numbers back into words. Without it, the entire system would be silent.</p>

<section id="binary-dataset-format-train.bin-and-val.bin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="binary-dataset-format-train.bin-and-val.bin">12. Binary Dataset Format (<code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>)</h3>
<p>Just like the tokenizer turns text into numbers, the datasets in <em>llm.c</em> are stored as numbers too. Instead of reading plain text files like <code>.txt</code>, the training and validation data are kept in simple binary files: <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>. These files are the fuel for the training loop.</p>
<section id="what-these-files-look-like" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-these-files-look-like">What These Files Look Like</h4>
<p>At first glance, <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code> look like unreadable blobs if you open them in a text editor. That’s because they are not meant to be human-readable. They contain:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">

<p>Each integer represents one token from the tokenizer’s vocabulary. Since GPT-2 has a vocabulary of about 50,000 tokens, 16-bit integers (<code>uint16_t</code>) are enough to store them all.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-binary-format" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-binary-format">Why Binary Format?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency: Instead of re-tokenizing text every time, the data is pre-tokenized once and stored as numbers. The trainer just reads them directly.</li>
<li>Speed: Reading integers from a file is faster than parsing and processing raw text.</li>
<li>Simplicity: The training loop only has to deal with arrays of integers-no string handling, no parsing, no surprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>This choice makes the training code in <em>llm.c</em> much cleaner and faster.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-dataloader-uses-them" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-the-dataloader-uses-them">How the Dataloader Uses Them</h4>
<p>When training starts, the dataloader reads chunks of numbers from <code>train.bin</code>. Each chunk corresponds to one batch of size B × T:</p>
<ul>
<li>B = batch size (number of examples in a batch).</li>
<li>T = sequence length (number of tokens per example).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if <code>B = 8</code> and <code>T = 1024</code>, the dataloader will read <code>8 × 1024 = 8192</code> token IDs from the file, reshape them into sequences, and feed them to the model.</p>
<p>The validation file (<code>val.bin</code>) works the same way but is only used occasionally during training to measure validation loss. This helps detect overfitting.</p>

<li>Reset allows re-reading from the beginning when you start a new epoch.</li>

<p>The target array is simply the same sequence shifted by one token-because language modeling predicts the <em>next</em> token.</p>

You’ll find its interface in <code>llmc/dataloader.h</code>, and its purpose is very simple: take a big stream of token IDs from <code>train.bin</code> or <code>val.bin</code>, cut it into manageable chunks, and serve those chunks to the training loop as batches.</p>

<p>Here’s what each does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dataloader_init</code>: opens the dataset file, remembers batch size <code>B</code> and sequence length <code>T</code>.</li>
<li><code>dataloader_next_batch</code>: returns the next chunk of <code>B × T</code> tokens (inputs) and their shifted version (targets).</li>
<li><code>dataloader_reset</code>: rewinds to the start of the file when an epoch ends.</li>
<li><code>dataloader_free</code>: closes the file and releases memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>This design keeps the training loop clean: just call <code>next_batch</code> and you get the data ready for forward/backward passes.</p>
</section>
<section id="b-t-explained" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b-t-explained">B × T Explained</h4>
<p>The two most important parameters are:</p>

<tr class="even">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>So one batch contains <code>B × T</code> tokens. For example, with <code>B = 16</code> and <code>T = 1024</code>, each batch holds 16,384 tokens. The DataLoader simply reads that many numbers from the binary file and arranges them in memory.</p>
</section>
<section id="strides-through-the-dataset" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strides-through-the-dataset">Strides Through the Dataset</h4>
<p>As you call <code>dataloader_next_batch</code>, the loader moves forward through the dataset by <code>B × T</code> tokens each time. When it reaches the end of the dataset file, it either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resets back to the beginning (<code>dataloader_reset</code>), or</li>
<li>Switches from training to validation, depending on the training loop’s needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This stride-based reading is efficient: no random access, just sequential reads from a file.</p>
</section>
<section id="epochs-and-shuffling" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="epochs-and-shuffling">Epochs and Shuffling</h4>
<p>In deep learning, an epoch means one full pass through the dataset. The DataLoader in <em>llm.c</em> is simple: it goes linearly from start to finish. It doesn’t shuffle data like PyTorch’s <code>DataLoader</code>. Why? Because language data is already very diverse, and the project values minimal code over extra features. If you want shuffling, you can preprocess the dataset differently before creating <code>.bin</code> files.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-3">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>The DataLoader is the quiet workhorse of training. It ensures that every step sees a fresh batch of token sequences, always with matching inputs and targets. By separating dataset reading from the training loop, the code stays clean and focused. This design also makes it easy to swap datasets-once you generate a <code>.bin</code> file, the loader doesn’t care where it came from.</p>

<li>Check epoch length: Write a small loop to count how many batches you get before <code>dataloader_reset</code> is called. Does this match the total tokens divided by <code>B × T</code>?</li>
<li>Validation check: Observe how often the training loop switches to <code>val.bin</code>. How does validation loss compare to training loss over time?</li>

<section id="the-takeaway-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-3">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>The DataLoader in <em>llm.c</em> is intentionally simple. It streams token IDs in fixed-sized batches, moves forward stride by stride, and resets when done. This straightforward design avoids complexity and keeps the focus on the model itself, while still teaching you the essential mechanics of batching and sequence handling in language model training.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evalloader-and-validation-workflow">15. EvalLoader and Validation Workflow</h3>
<p>Training a model isn’t just about watching the training loss go down. To know whether the model is actually learning patterns that generalize-and not just memorizing the training data-you need to run validation. In <em>llm.c</em>, validation is handled by a component called the EvalLoader, which works just like the DataLoader but reads from the validation dataset (<code>val.bin</code>) instead of the training dataset (<code>train.bin</code>).</p>
<section id="why-we-need-validation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-we-need-validation">Why We Need Validation</h4>
<p>Imagine teaching a student only by drilling them with the same math problems over and over. They might get really good at those problems, but fail completely when given new ones. Validation is like giving the student a pop quiz with unseen questions. If they do well, you know they’ve actually learned the concepts.</p>
<p>For language models, validation helps detect overfitting: when the training loss keeps improving but the validation loss stays flat or even gets worse.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-evalloader-works" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-evalloader-works">How EvalLoader Works</h4>
<p>EvalLoader lives in the same code file as the DataLoader (<code>llmc/dataloader.h</code>), but it points to a different dataset file. Its workflow is nearly identical:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open <code>val.bin</code> and prepare for reading.</li>
<li>Serve up batches of size <code>B × T</code> (batch size × sequence length).</li>
<li>Provide inputs and targets the same way as the training DataLoader.</li>
<li>Reset after one full pass through the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>The training loop typically calls the EvalLoader at intervals-for example, every few hundred steps-so you get a snapshot of validation loss during training.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-happens-during-validation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-happens-during-validation">What Happens During Validation</h4>
<p>When validation is triggered:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The current model parameters are frozen (no gradient updates).</li>
<li>A few batches are read from <code>val.bin</code>.</li>
<li>The model runs forward passes only, computing the loss on each batch.</li>
<li>The losses are averaged and reported as validation loss.</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn’t take long because it usually samples just a subset of the validation dataset, not the entire file.</p>

<p>Validation is the reality check of training. Without it, you could train forever and celebrate low training losses, only to discover that your model produces nonsense on new text. By tracking validation loss, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect overfitting early.</li>
<li>Adjust hyperparameters (like learning rate or batch size).</li>
<li>Know when training has plateaued and it’s time to stop.</li>

<p>The EvalLoader is a twin of the DataLoader, but for validation. It feeds the model data it has never seen during training, and the resulting validation loss tells you whether your model is learning useful patterns or just memorizing. It’s the simplest safeguard against wasted compute, and it’s an essential part of every training loop-even in the stripped-down world of <em>llm.c</em>.</p>

<section id="sequence-length-and-memory-budgeting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sequence-length-and-memory-budgeting">16. Sequence Length and Memory Budgeting</h3>
<p>When training GPT-2 in <em>llm.c</em>, one of the most important decisions you make is choosing the sequence length (often called T). This value determines how many tokens the model processes in a single forward pass. It might sound like just another parameter, but sequence length has a huge impact on what the model can learn, how much memory it uses, and how fast training runs.</p>
<section id="what-sequence-length-means" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-sequence-length-means">What Sequence Length Means</h4>
<p>Sequence length is simply the number of tokens per training example. If <code>T = 1024</code>, the model reads 1,024 tokens in a row (like words or subwords) and tries to predict the next token at each position.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: if you give the model a paragraph of text, sequence length is how much of that paragraph it sees at once. Shorter lengths give the model less context, while longer lengths allow it to capture bigger patterns, like whole paragraphs or even multiple pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-it-appears-in-the-code" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-it-appears-in-the-code">Where It Appears in the Code</h4>
<p>In the logs, you’ll often see lines like:</p>
<pre><code>max_seq_len: 1024</code></pre>
<p>This number is defined in the GPT-2 configuration and passed into the DataLoader. The DataLoader slices chunks of exactly <code>T</code> tokens from <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>. The model itself has fixed positional embeddings of size <code>T</code>, so it cannot process sequences longer than this maximum.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-costs-of-longer-sequences" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memory-costs-of-longer-sequences">Memory Costs of Longer Sequences</h4>
<p>Transformers are powerful but expensive. The attention mechanism compares every token to every other token in the sequence. This means memory and compute scale with the square of sequence length:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Sequence Length (T)</th>
<th>Relative Attention Cost</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>256</td>

<tr class="even">

<p>So doubling <code>T</code> doesn’t just double the cost-it multiplies it by four. That’s why training at long context lengths requires a lot of GPU memory.</p>

<section id="trade-offs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Shorter sequences: Faster, less memory, but limited context. Good for quick experiments or tiny datasets like Tiny Shakespeare.</li>
<li>Longer sequences: More memory, slower, but the model can understand larger spans of text. Required for large-scale GPT-2 training.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of sequence length as a dial: turning it up increases the model’s ability to “remember,” but it also makes training much heavier.</p>

<p>Choosing sequence length is about balancing learning power against hardware limits. A too-small sequence length can prevent the model from capturing long-term dependencies. A too-large one can make training impossible on your hardware. Every run of <em>llm.c</em> is a negotiation between what you’d like the model to see and what your system can handle.</p>

<li>Batch trade-off: Try reducing batch size <code>B</code> while increasing <code>T</code>. Can you keep GPU memory stable while giving the model more context?</li>

This happens because many parts of training involve randomness. In <em>llm.c</em>, reproducibility is controlled by random seeds. A seed is a starting point for a random number generator.

<section id="how-llm.c-defends-against-bad-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-llm.c-defends-against-bad-data">How <em>llm.c</em> Defends Against Bad Data</h4>
<p>The repository makes heavy use of asserts-simple checks that stop the program immediately if something unexpected happens. For example, in <code>llmc/utils.h</code>, functions like <code>freadCheck</code> and <code>mallocCheck</code> ensure that file reads and memory allocations succeed. If not, they print an error message and abort instead of silently failing.</p>
<p>Inside the DataLoader, token IDs are often validated to make sure they fall inside the expected vocabulary range. If you try to access an invalid index in the embedding table, the program will crash quickly, which is better than continuing with corrupted values.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-vocab-range-check" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-vocab-range-check">Example: Vocab Range Check</h4>
<p>During training, every input token is used to look up a row in the embedding matrix. If a token ID is too large, you’d access memory outside the matrix. This is why checking <code>0 &lt;= id &lt; vocab_size</code> is essential. In C, asserts provide this safety net.</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>assert<span class="op">(</span>id <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> id <span class="op">&lt;</span> vocab_size<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This kind of check may look simple, but it saves hours of debugging mysterious crashes.</p>

<section id="error-surfaces-in-loss" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="error-surfaces-in-loss">Error Surfaces in Loss</h4>
<p>Even if your program doesn’t crash, bad data can create “error surfaces” in the loss function:</p>
<ul>
<li>NaNs: Appear when invalid values propagate through softmax, layernorm, or division operations.</li>
<li>Flat loss: If the dataset is empty or repetitive, the model never improves.</li>
<li>Mismatch behavior: Training loss decreases but validation loss stays high if training and validation sets use inconsistent tokenization.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are signs that something is wrong with the dataset or preprocessing.</p>

<section id="why-it-matters-7" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-7">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>C is a low-level language with very little safety by default. One out-of-range index can corrupt memory and cause unpredictable bugs. By aggressively checking assumptions (file sizes, vocab bounds, token IDs), <em>llm.c</em> turns hard-to-find errors into immediate, clear failures. For learners, this makes it much easier to understand what went wrong.</p>

<li>Corrupt a dataset: Open <code>train.bin</code> and delete a few bytes. Run training and see what error appears. Notice how quickly asserts catch it.</li>
<li>Force a bad ID: Modify the DataLoader to add <code>+100000</code> to a token. Does the model crash with an assertion?</li>
<li>Skip asserts: Temporarily disable checks and rerun. Compare how much harder it is to figure out what went wrong.</li>
<li>Validation mismatch: Tokenize a file with a different tokenizer and save it as <code>val.bin</code>. Watch how the validation loss behaves compared to training loss.</li>

<section id="the-takeaway-7" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-7">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>Bad data can silently sabotage training, but <em>llm.c</em> uses asserts and bounds checks to make errors loud and clear. This design choice helps learners focus on the real logic of transformers instead of chasing hidden bugs caused by corrupted or mismatched datasets. In machine learning, good data hygiene and strict validation are as important as the model itself.</p>

<section id="tokenization-edge-cases-unks-eos-bos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenization-edge-cases-unks-eos-bos">19. Tokenization Edge Cases (UNKs, EOS, BOS)</h3>
<p>Tokenization looks simple at first: take text, split it into tokens, and assign each token an ID. But in practice, there are always tricky situations. <em>llm.c</em> inherits the quirks of the GPT-2 tokenizer, which is byte-level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding). This design mostly avoids “unknown” tokens, but it still has details you need to understand when preparing datasets or interpreting outputs.</p>
<section id="no-true-unk-in-gpt-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-true-unk-in-gpt-2">No True “UNK” in GPT-2</h4>
<p>Some tokenizers, like those used in earlier NLP systems, include a special <code>UNK</code> (unknown) token for words that aren’t in the vocabulary. GPT-2 avoids this problem by working at the byte level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every possible byte (0–255) is in the base vocabulary.</li>
<li>If the tokenizer doesn’t know how to split a character or word, it just falls back to raw bytes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That means you will never see an <code>UNK</code> token in <em>llm.c</em>. Any input text is always representable. This is one of the main reasons GPT-2’s tokenizer is so robust.</p>
</section>
<section id="special-tokens-eos-and-bos" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="special-tokens-eos-and-bos">Special Tokens: EOS and BOS</h4>
<p>Even though GPT-2 doesn’t use <code>UNK</code>, it does use other special tokens:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%">
<col style="width: 14%">
<col style="width: 64%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Token</th>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>EOS (End of Sequence)</td>
<td>50256</td>
<td>Marks the end of a text segment. Used during training and sampling.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>BOS (Beginning of Sequence)</td>
<td>Not explicit in GPT-2</td>
<td>GPT-2 doesn’t use a fixed BOS token. Instead, the model assumes generation starts at position 0.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, you’ll often see <code>EOS</code> at the end of training sequences or when sampling text. If you generate text and see strange endings, it’s usually because the model predicted <code>EOS</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="whitespace-quirks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whitespace-quirks">Whitespace Quirks</h4>
<p>The tokenizer also handles whitespace in a slightly unusual way. For example, the word “hello” and the word ” hello” (with a leading space) map to different tokens. This is why generated text sometimes starts with a space-it’s part of the token definition.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"hello"</code> → token ID 31373</li>
<li><code>" hello"</code> → token ID 15496</li>
</ul>
<p>This is normal behavior for GPT-2. It helps the model capture spacing and punctuation consistently.</p>
</section>
<section id="unicode-and-rare-characters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unicode-and-rare-characters">Unicode and Rare Characters</h4>
<p>Because it’s byte-level, GPT-2 can encode emojis, accented characters, or even binary junk data. But the BPE merges are optimized for English, so rare characters often get split into multiple byte tokens. That means sequences with lots of rare symbols (like Chinese or emojis) will use more tokens than plain English text.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters-8" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-8">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>Edge cases in tokenization affect both dataset preparation and model outputs. If you see weird spacing or early <code>EOS</code> tokens, it’s not a bug-it’s just how the tokenizer works. Understanding these quirks helps you debug outputs and prepare datasets without surprises.</p>
</section>

<ol type="1">
<li>EOS inspection: Open <code>val.bin</code> with a hex viewer and look for token ID <code>50256</code>. These mark the ends of text segments.</li>
<li>Whitespace check: Use the tokenizer to encode <code>"hello"</code> and <code>" hello"</code>. Compare the token IDs.</li>
<li>Emoji test: Encode a string with emojis (e.g., <code>"🙂🙂🙂"</code>) and see how many tokens it becomes.</li>
<li>Rare character dataset: Create a small <code>.txt</code> file with accented characters and tokenize it. How many bytes does each character consume?</li>

<section id="the-takeaway-8" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-8">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>Tokenization in GPT-2 is robust, but it has quirks. There are no unknown tokens thanks to byte-level encoding, but whitespace and special tokens like <code>EOS</code> play important roles. By experimenting with these edge cases, you’ll develop an intuition for how raw text is mapped into the numbers that drive training and generation in <em>llm.c</em>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-hygiene-and-logging">20. Data Hygiene and Logging</h3>
<p>When training with <em>llm.c</em>, having clean data is just as important as having the right model code. If the dataset contains errors, duplicates, or formatting issues, the model may waste capacity memorizing noise instead of learning useful patterns. This is where data hygiene comes in-making sure your training and validation sets are prepared properly. Alongside this, logging ensures you can monitor what’s happening during training and catch problems early.</p>
<section id="what-data-hygiene-means" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-data-hygiene-means">What Data Hygiene Means</h4>
<p>Data hygiene is about making sure your dataset is both valid and useful. For language models, this includes:</p>

</section>
<section id="logging-during-training" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logging-during-training">Logging During Training</h4>
<p>Once training starts, logging becomes your window into what’s happening. <em>llm.c</em> uses a minimal logging system (<code>llmc/logger.h</code>) to print progress to the console. Typical logs include:</p>
<pre><code>step 0: train loss 5.19, val loss 5.32
step 100: train loss 4.87, val loss 5.01
step 200: train loss 4.62, val loss 4.88</code></pre>
<p>These numbers let you track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training loss: Is the model fitting the data?</li>
<li>Validation loss: Is it generalizing, or overfitting?</li>
<li>Step timing: How long each batch takes, useful for profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in such a small project, this logging loop gives you most of what you need to debug runs.</p>
</section>

<li>If loss suddenly becomes <code>NaN</code>, your dataset might contain corrupt tokens.</li>
<li>If loss plateaus at a high value, you may have too little data or poor preprocessing.</li>

<p>The GPT-2 config struct in <em>llm.c</em> is small but powerful. It defines everything about the model’s architecture: vocabulary, sequence length, depth, width, and total parameters. By adjusting just a few integers, you can scale from a toy model that runs on CPU to a billion-parameter giant (if your hardware allows it). Understanding these numbers is the first step to understanding how transformer capacity is controlled.</p>

<p>Once the GPT-2 configuration is set, the next big step is to allocate the parameters of the model. These are the trainable numbers-weights and biases-that define how the model processes input tokens. In <em>llm.c</em>, parameters are stored in flat arrays of floats rather than in deeply nested objects like in PyTorch. This choice makes the code easier to read and keeps memory access predictable.</p>

<li>Attention layers: query, key, value, and output projections.</li>
<li>MLP layers: two linear layers plus their biases.</li>
<li>LayerNorms: scale (<code>gamma</code>) and shift (<code>beta</code>) values.</li>

<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, parameters are not hidden inside classes or objects. They live in one flat block of memory, sliced up by convention into embeddings, attention matrices, MLP weights, and norms. This design makes the relationship between model architecture and memory crystal clear-and reminds you that even a billion-parameter transformer is “just” a giant array of numbers.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-tables-token-positional">23. Embedding Tables: Token + Positional</h3>
<p>Before a transformer can reason about text, it first needs to turn tokens into vectors. In <em>llm.c</em>, this job is handled by the embedding tables: one for tokens, one for positions. These tables are the very first layer of GPT-2, and they transform plain integer IDs into continuous values that the neural network can process.</p>
<section id="token-embedding-table" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token-embedding-table">Token Embedding Table</h4>
<p>When you feed in a batch of token IDs, the model looks up their corresponding vectors in the token embedding table.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shape: <code>[vocab_size, channels]</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>vocab_size ≈ 50,257</code> (for GPT-2)</li>
<li><code>channels = hidden size</code> (768 for GPT-2 Small)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Each row corresponds to one token in the vocabulary.</p></li>
<li><p>Each row is a dense vector of size <code>channels</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So if your input batch has size <code>(B, T)</code>, looking up embeddings gives you a tensor of shape <code>(B, T, channels)</code>.</p>
<p>In the code, this is implemented as an array slice from the flat parameter block:</p>

<p>Transformers don’t inherently know about word order. That’s what positional embeddings are for.</p>

<li><p>Each position (0, 1, 2, …, 1023) has its own vector.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During training, when the model sees token <code>i</code> at position <code>j</code>, it takes the token embedding vector and adds the positional embedding vector for <code>j</code>. This gives the model both word identity and word position.</p>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, positional embeddings immediately follow the token embeddings in the flat parameter array.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-idea-of-normalization">The Idea of Normalization</h4>
<p>When you pass vectors through many layers, their values can become unbalanced-some features dominate while others shrink. Normalization fixes this by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Centering: subtracting the mean of the vector.</li>
<li>Scaling: dividing by the standard deviation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes every feature vector have mean 0 and variance 1, improving stability.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-layer-norm" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-layer-norm">Why “Layer” Norm?</h4>
<p>There are different kinds of normalization (BatchNorm, InstanceNorm, etc.). LayerNorm is special because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It normalizes across the features of a single token (the “layer”), not across the batch.</li>
<li>This makes it independent of batch size, which is important for NLP where batch sizes can vary.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the code, LayerNorm is implemented as a simple function that loops over features, computes mean and variance, and applies the formula above. It’s not hidden inside a framework-it’s right there in C, so you can step through it line by line.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-it-fits-in-gpt-2">Where It Fits in GPT-2</h4>
<p>Each transformer block contains two LayerNorms:</p>
<ul>
<li>One before attention.</li>
<li>One before the MLP.</li>
</ul>
<p>GPT-2 uses Pre-LN architecture: inputs are normalized before each sublayer. This makes training more stable and gradients flow better.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters-13" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-13">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>LayerNorm may look like a small detail, but without it, GPT-2 would fail to train reliably. It smooths out the flow of activations so attention and MLP layers can do their job. In practice, this is one of the critical “glue” components that makes deep transformers trainable at scale.</p>

<p>LayerNorm is the quiet stabilizer of GPT-2. It makes sure each token’s features stay balanced, while γ and β keep flexibility. In <em>llm.c</em>, it’s implemented directly with clear C code, letting you see exactly how normalization is calculated. It’s a small but indispensable piece of the transformer puzzle.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="residual-connections-keeping-the-signal-flowing">27. Residual Connections: Keeping the Signal Flowing</h3>
<p>Transformers like GPT-2 don’t just stack layers on top of each other blindly. They use residual connections-a trick that allows the input of a layer to be added back to its output. This simple addition helps signals flow through the network without vanishing or exploding, and it makes training deep models possible.</p>
<section id="the-basic-idea" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-basic-idea">The Basic Idea</h4>
<p>Imagine you have a function <code>F(x)</code> representing some transformation (like attention or an MLP). Instead of just computing:</p>
<pre><code>y = F(x)</code></pre>
<p>the transformer does:</p>
<pre><code>y = F(x) + x</code></pre>
<p>This means the layer learns only the <em>difference</em> it needs to add to the input, instead of replacing it entirely.</p>

<section id="why-this-helps" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-helps">Why This Helps</h4>
<p>Residuals solve two big problems in deep networks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gradient flow: During backpropagation, gradients can get smaller and smaller as they pass through many layers. Adding the input back ensures gradients always have a path straight through.</li>
<li>Information preservation: Even if <code>F(x)</code> distorts the signal, the original <code>x</code> is still there. This prevents the model from “forgetting” important information.</li>
<li>Faster training: The network doesn’t have to re-learn identity mappings-it can just pass them through the skip connection.</li>

<li>Attention residual: Adds the input of the attention layer to its output.</li>
<li>MLP residual: Adds the input of the MLP to its output.</li>

<p>Without residual connections, stacking 12–48 transformer blocks would be nearly impossible to train. Gradients would vanish, and the model would either stop learning or take forever to converge. Residuals let deep transformers scale smoothly.</p>
<p>They also add an intuitive interpretation: each block is like a “refinement step” rather than a full rewrite of the representation.</p>

<p>Residual connections are the “lifeline” of deep transformers. By simply adding inputs back into outputs, they make it possible to train very deep networks without losing gradients or information.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attention-masking-enforcing-causality">28. Attention Masking: Enforcing Causality</h3>
<p>One of the defining traits of GPT-2 is that it’s a causal language model. That means it predicts the <em>next</em> token given all the tokens before it, but never cheats by looking ahead. To enforce this, GPT-2 applies an attention mask inside every attention layer.</p>
<section id="why-a-mask-is-needed" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-a-mask-is-needed">Why a Mask Is Needed</h4>
<p>Without a mask, attention is free to connect any token to any other, including future ones. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: “The cat sat on the”</li>
<li>Target: “mat”</li>
</ul>
<p>If the model could peek at “mat” while computing attention, the task would be trivial-it could just copy the next word. That would break the training objective.</p>
<p>The mask forces the model to only use tokens at or before the current position when making predictions.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-mask-works" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-the-mask-works">How the Mask Works</h4>
<p>When computing attention scores (<code>Q × K^T / sqrt(d_k)</code>), the result is a matrix of size <code>[T, T]</code> where each row corresponds to one token attending to all others.</p>
<p>The mask modifies this matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed positions (past and present): keep scores as is.</li>
<li>Disallowed positions (future): set scores to <code>-inf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After applying softmax, those <code>-inf</code> entries become zero probability, effectively blocking attention to the future.</p>

<p>After tokens pass through embeddings, attention, MLPs, LayerNorm, and residuals, we end up with hidden states for every position in the sequence. But GPT-2’s final job is not to output vectors-it must predict the next token from the vocabulary. This is handled by the output head, the last stage of the model.</p>
<section id="what-the-output-head-does" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-output-head-does">What the Output Head Does</h4>
<p>The output head maps hidden states of shape <code>(B, T, channels)</code> into logits of shape <code>(B, T, vocab_size)</code>. Each logit represents the model’s “raw score” for how likely a particular token is at the next step.</p>
<p>The pipeline looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>hidden states → Linear projection → Logits → Softmax → Probabilities</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Logits: real numbers, one per token in the vocabulary.</li>
<li>Softmax: converts logits into probabilities that sum to 1.</li>

</ul>

<pre><code>probs = softmax(logits)</code></pre>
<p>Softmax ensures two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All values are between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>They sum to 1 across the vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for each position, you get a probability distribution over all possible next tokens.</p>

<p>Cross-entropy compares the predicted distribution <code>p</code> with the true distribution <code>q</code>. For language modeling:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>q</code> is a one-hot vector (all zeros, except 1 at the true token index).</li>

<p>The cross-entropy loss is the compass guiding GPT-2 during training. It turns raw logits into probabilities and measures how well the model predicts the correct next token. In <em>llm.c</em>, it’s implemented with explicit loops and math, letting you see exactly how probabilities and losses are computed. Without this step, the model would have no way to learn from its mistakes.</p>

<section id="forward-pass-walkthrough" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forward-pass-walkthrough">31. Forward Pass Walkthrough</h3>
<p>When we talk about the <em>forward pass</em> in GPT-2, we mean the process of turning an input sentence (like “The cat sat on the”) into predictions for the next word. In simple terms, it’s how the model “thinks” before giving an answer. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, this happens inside the function <code>gpt2_forward</code>. Let’s walk through it slowly, step by step, so you can see how numbers flow through the model and transform along the way.</p>
<section id="from-words-to-numbers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-words-to-numbers">1. From Words to Numbers</h4>
<p>Computers don’t understand words like <em>cat</em> or <em>sat</em>. They only understand numbers. Before the forward pass starts, text is already tokenized into IDs (integers). For example:</p>
<pre><code>"The cat sat" → [464, 3290, 616]</code></pre>
<p>Each number is a token ID. The model doesn’t yet know what “464” means in plain English-it just knows it’s a number that points into a table.</p>
</section>
<section id="embedding-giving-words-meaning" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-giving-words-meaning">2. Embedding: Giving Words Meaning</h4>
<p>The first real step in the forward pass is embedding lookup. Imagine we have a huge dictionary, but instead of definitions in English, each word ID points to a long vector of numbers (say, 768 numbers for GPT-2 small).</p>
<ul>
<li>Word embeddings (<code>wte</code>): Each token ID becomes a vector that captures the meaning of the word.</li>
<li>Position embeddings (<code>wpe</code>): Each token also gets a vector for its position: first word, second word, third word, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model adds these two vectors together. This way, it knows not just what the word is, but also where it is in the sentence.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 5%">
<col style="width: 5%">
<col style="width: 29%">
<col style="width: 34%">
<col style="width: 24%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Token</th>
<th>Word</th>
<th>Word Embedding (shortened)</th>
<th>Position Embedding (shortened)</th>
<th>Combined Vector</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>464</td>
<td>“The”</td>
<td>[0.2, -0.5, 0.1, …]</td>
<td>[0.0, 0.1, -0.3, …]</td>
<td>[0.2, -0.4, -0.2, …]</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3290</td>
<td>“cat”</td>
<td>[0.9, -0.2, 0.4, …]</td>
<td>[0.1, -0.1, -0.2, …]</td>
<td>[1.0, -0.3, 0.2, …]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now every token is a vector with both meaning and position built in.</p>

<section id="transformer-layers-the-thinking-steps" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformer-layers-the-thinking-steps">3. Transformer Layers: The Thinking Steps</h4>
<p>GPT-2 has multiple identical layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer has two big parts: attention and MLP (feed-forward network).</p>
<p>Attention (looking around):</p>
<ul>
<li>Each word asks: “Which other words should I pay attention to right now?”</li>
<li>For “sat,” attention might focus heavily on “cat,” because those words are related.</li>
<li>The code computes <em>queries</em>, <em>keys</em>, and <em>values</em> for every word, then does dot-products, softmax, and weighted sums to mix information.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLP (processing deeply):</p>
<ul>
<li>After attention, each token passes through a mini neural network (two matrix multiplications with a nonlinear GELU function in between).</li>
<li>This helps each word refine its understanding, even if it doesn’t directly attend to another word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both blocks have residual connections: the input is added back to the output, like keeping the original notes while adding new insights. This prevents information loss.</p>
</section>
<section id="normalization-keeping-numbers-stable" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="normalization-keeping-numbers-stable">4. Normalization: Keeping Numbers Stable</h4>
<p>At many points, the model normalizes vectors so they don’t explode in size or shrink too small. This is called LayerNorm. It ensures training is stable, like making sure your cooking pot doesn’t boil over or dry out.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-final-prediction-layer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-final-prediction-layer">5. The Final Prediction Layer</h4>
<p>After all layers, the model produces a final vector for each position. Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>It multiplies those vectors by the embedding table again (but transposed).</li>
<li>This gives logits: raw scores for each word in the vocabulary (about 50k options).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: for the last token “on the,” the logits might be:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Word</th>
<th>Logit</th>
<th>Probability (after softmax)</th>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="softmax-turning-scores-into-probabilities">6. Softmax: Turning Scores into Probabilities</h4>
<p>The logits are big numbers, but they don’t mean much until we apply softmax. Softmax makes them into probabilities that sum to 1. This way, we can interpret them as chances: “There’s an 85% chance the next word is <em>mat</em>.”</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-entropy-loss-measuring-mistakes" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-entropy-loss-measuring-mistakes">7. Cross-Entropy Loss: Measuring Mistakes</h4>
<p>If we’re training, we also give the model the correct next word. The model checks how much probability it gave to that word. If it gave it high probability, the loss is low. If it gave it low probability, the loss is high.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: “mat” (probability 0.85 → loss ≈ 0.16, small).</li>
<li>Wrong: “car” (probability 0.05 → loss ≈ 3.0, large).</li>
</ul>
<p>This loss is averaged across all tokens, and it’s the signal that tells the backward pass how to update the model.</p>

<p>The forward pass is the part of GPT-2 that generates predictions. Without it, the model can’t “think” or make sense of input.

<li>Inspect probabilities: After the forward pass, print the softmax probabilities for one position. They should sum to 1.0.</li>
<li>Change sequence length: Increase <code>T</code> from 64 to 128. Notice how validation slows down, because attention compares all tokens with all others (<code>T²</code> scaling).</li>
<li>Baseline loss: Before training, measure the loss. It should be around <code>log(vocab_size)</code> (≈10.8 for GPT-2 small). That’s the loss of random guessing.</li>
<li>Mask experiment: Temporarily remove the causal mask in attention. The model will “cheat” by looking ahead, and loss will drop unrealistically.</li>
</ol>

<section id="the-takeaway-20" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-20">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>The forward pass is like the thought process of GPT-2. Input words become vectors, vectors mix through attention and MLPs, everything gets normalized, and finally the model produces probabilities for the next word. It’s a carefully choreographed dance of math operations, all coded in plain C loops in <code>train_gpt2.c</code>. Once you understand this flow, you can follow exactly how GPT-2 turns raw tokens into intelligent predictions.</p>

<section id="token-and-positional-embedding-lookup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token-and-positional-embedding-lookup">32. Token and Positional Embedding Lookup</h3>
<p>Before GPT-2 can do anything intelligent with text, it needs to turn raw numbers (token IDs) into vectors that capture meaning and context. This is the role of embeddings. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, this step is handled by the function <code>encoder_forward</code>. Let’s take a closer look at how it works and why it matters.</p>
<section id="tokens-are-just-numbers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokens-are-just-numbers">Tokens Are Just Numbers</h4>
<p>Suppose you type:</p>
<pre><code>"The cat sat on the mat."</code></pre>
<p>After tokenization, this sentence might look like:</p>
<pre><code>[464, 3290, 616, 319, 262, 1142, 13]</code></pre>
<p>These are just IDs. The model doesn’t inherently know that <code>3290</code> means “cat.” It only knows it needs to use these numbers to fetch vectors from a table.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-embedding-tables" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-embedding-tables">The Embedding Tables</h4>
<p>The model has two important tables stored in memory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Word Token Embeddings (<code>wte</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Size: <code>(V, C)</code> where <code>V</code> is vocab size (~50,000 for GPT-2 small) and <code>C</code> is channels (768).</li>
<li>Each row corresponds to a token ID.</li>
<li>Example: row 3290 might be <code>[0.12, -0.45, 0.88, …]</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Positional Embeddings (<code>wpe</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Size: <code>(maxT, C)</code> where <code>maxT</code> is the maximum sequence length (e.g.&nbsp;1024).</li>
<li>Each row corresponds to a position index: 0 for the first token, 1 for the second, etc.</li>
<li>Example: position 2 might be <code>[0.07, 0.31, -0.22, …]</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Both tables are filled with trainable values. At the start, they’re random. As training progresses, the optimizer updates them so they encode useful patterns.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-them-together-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-them-together-1">Adding Them Together</h4>
<p>For each token at position <code>t</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up its word vector from <code>wte</code>.</li>
<li>Look up its position vector from <code>wpe</code>.</li>
<li>Add them elementwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives a final vector of size <code>C</code> that represents what the token is and where it is.</p>
<p>Example with simplified numbers:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">

<p>Now the vector doesn’t just mean “cat,” it means “cat at position 1.”</p>
</section>
<section id="why-position-matters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-position-matters">Why Position Matters</h4>
<p>Without positions, the model would treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The cat sat”</li>
<li>“Sat cat the”</li>
</ul>
<p>as identical, because they use the same tokens. But word order is essential in language. By adding positional embeddings, GPT-2 knows the difference between “dog bites man” and “man bites dog.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attention-matmuls-masking-and-softmax-on-cpu">33. Attention: Matmuls, Masking, and Softmax on CPU</h3>
<p>The attention mechanism is the heart of GPT-2. It’s where each word in the input sequence decides which other words to look at when forming its representation. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, this happens inside the <code>attention_forward</code> function, which implements multi-head self-attention using plain C loops and matrix multiplications. Let’s break it down carefully, step by step, so even an absolute beginner can follow the flow.</p>
<section id="the-big-idea-of-attention" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-big-idea-of-attention">The Big Idea of Attention</h4>
<p>Imagine you’re reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The cat sat on the mat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the model is trying to understand the word <em>sat</em>, it doesn’t just look at <em>sat</em> by itself. It wants to consider other words like <em>cat</em> (the subject) and <em>mat</em> (likely the object). Attention gives each token a way to “consult” earlier tokens and decide how important they are.</p>
<p>This is done mathematically by projecting each token into three roles: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).</p>
<ul>
<li>Query (Q): “What am I looking for?”</li>
<li>Key (K): “What do I offer?”</li>
<li>Value (V): “What information do I carry?”</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-creating-q-k-and-v">Step 1: Creating Q, K, and V</h4>
<p>For every input vector of size <code>C</code> (e.g., 768), the code performs three separate linear projections (matrix multiplications). These produce Q, K, and V vectors of smaller size, divided among attention heads.</p>
<p>In the code:</p>

<p>GPT-2 is an autoregressive model, meaning it only predicts the future from the past, not the other way around. To enforce this, the attention matrix is masked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token at position <code>t</code> can only look at positions <code>≤ t</code>.</li>
<li>Anything beyond <code>t</code> is set to a very negative value (<code>-1e9</code>), which becomes effectively zero after softmax.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures, for example, that when predicting the 3rd word, the model doesn’t cheat by looking at the 4th.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-turning-scores-into-probabilities">Step 4: Turning Scores into Probabilities</h4>
<p>The scores are raw numbers that can be large and unstable. To convert them into meaningful weights, the code applies softmax:</p>
<pre><code>attention_weights[t][u] = exp(score[t][u]) / Σ exp(score[t][v])</code></pre>
<p>This makes all weights positive and ensures they sum to 1. Now each token has a probability distribution over earlier tokens.</p>
<p>Example for the word <em>sat</em>:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Attended Token</th>
<th>Raw Score</th>

<p>After the attention block lets tokens “talk to each other,” GPT-2 applies a second kind of transformation called the MLP block (multi-layer perceptron). Unlike attention, which mixes information between tokens, the MLP processes each token independently, enriching its internal representation. Even though it looks simpler than attention, the MLP is essential for capturing complex relationships in language.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-mlp-does">What the MLP Does</h4>

<li>Nonlinear activation: apply the GELU function, which adds flexibility.</li>
<li>Linear projection back: reduce size from <code>4C</code> back to <code>C</code>.</li>
<li>Residual connection: add the input vector back to the output, keeping the original signal intact.</li>

<p>After expansion, each number passes through GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit).</p>
<p>The formula:</p>
<pre><code>GELU(x) = 0.5 * x * (1 + tanh(√(2/π) * (x + 0.044715 * x^3)))</code></pre>
<p>This looks complicated, but the key idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>For small negative numbers, output ≈ 0 (ignore weak signals).</li>
<li>For large positive numbers, output ≈ x (pass strong signals).</li>
<li>For numbers in between, it smoothly blends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike ReLU, which just chops off negatives, GELU lets small signals through in a probabilistic way. This makes it better for language, where even small hints matter.</p>
<p>Analogy: Imagine you’re grading homework. If an answer is completely wrong, you give 0 points (ReLU style). If it’s perfect, you give full credit. But if it’s partially right, you give partial credit. GELU behaves like that-soft, nuanced grading.</p>

<p>The MLP block is a token’s personal deep thinker. It stretches the representation wide, filters it through GELU, compresses it again, and then adds it back to the original. While attention handles the conversation between words, the MLP ensures each word processes and refines its own role. Together, they create the layered reasoning ability that makes GPT-2 so powerful.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="layernorm-on-cpu-step-by-step">35. LayerNorm on CPU (Step-by-Step)</h3>
<p>One of the most important but often overlooked ingredients in GPT-2 is Layer Normalization, or LayerNorm for short. While attention and MLPs are the big stars, LayerNorm is like the stage crew keeping everything running smoothly behind the scenes. It ensures the numbers flowing through the network stay stable and balanced, preventing explosions or collapses that could make training impossible. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, LayerNorm is implemented with explicit loops so you can see every calculation. Let’s walk through it carefully.</p>
<section id="why-do-we-need-normalization" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-need-normalization">Why Do We Need Normalization?</h4>
<p>Imagine a classroom where every student talks at different volumes. Some whisper, some shout. If you try to listen to all of them at once, the loud voices drown out the quiet ones.</p>
<p>Neural networks face a similar problem. The outputs of layers can have wildly different scales. If one dimension of a vector is much larger than the others, it dominates. Training becomes unstable, and gradients may vanish or explode.</p>
<p>LayerNorm fixes this by ensuring that, for each token at each layer, the vector has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean = 0 (centered around zero)</li>
<li>Variance = 1 (consistent spread of values)</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, trainable parameters scale and shift the result so the model can still learn flexible transformations.</p>

<section id="the-math-behind-layernorm" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-math-behind-layernorm">The Math Behind LayerNorm</h4>
<p>For a given token vector <code>x</code> of size <code>C</code> (e.g., 768):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Compute mean:</p>
<pre><code>μ = (1/C) * Σ x[i]</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Compute variance:</p>
<pre><code>σ² = (1/C) * Σ (x[i] - μ)²</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Normalize:</p>
<pre><code>x_norm[i] = (x[i] - μ) / sqrt(σ² + ε)</code></pre>
<p>where <code>ε</code> is a tiny constant (like 1e-5) to avoid division by zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Scale and shift with trainable weights <code>g</code> (gamma) and <code>b</code> (beta):</p>
<pre><code>y[i] = g[i] * x_norm[i] + b[i]</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>So the final output has controlled statistics, but still enough flexibility for the model to adjust.</p>

<p>LayerNorm is the quiet but critical stabilizer in GPT-2. It ensures every token vector is balanced, centered, and scaled before moving into attention or MLP. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, you see exactly how it works: compute mean, compute variance, normalize, then scale and shift. Even though it’s just a few lines of C code, it’s one of the main reasons deep transformers can stack dozens of layers without breaking.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="residual-adds-and-signal-flow">36. Residual Adds and Signal Flow</h3>
<p>Once embeddings, attention, and MLP blocks are computed, there’s still one piece left to keep the whole network stable and effective: residual connections. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, these appear in functions like <code>residual_forward</code>, where outputs of a layer are added back to their inputs. This simple-looking step is one of the key reasons GPT-2 and other deep transformer models can stack many layers without collapsing.</p>
<section id="the-core-idea-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-core-idea-1">The Core Idea</h4>
<p>A residual connection says:</p>
<pre><code>output = input + transformation(input)</code></pre>
<p>Instead of replacing the old representation with the new one, the model adds them together. That way, the original signal always survives, even if the new transformation is noisy or imperfect.</p>
<p>Think of it like taking lecture notes. Each time the teacher explains more, you don’t throw away your old notes. You add new details next to them. That way, you preserve everything learned so far, while layering new insights on top.</p>

<li><p>Preventing information loss: If you only applied transformations, some features might vanish forever. Adding the input back ensures no information is lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Helping gradients flow: During backpropagation, gradients must travel backward through many layers. Without shortcuts, they can vanish or explode. Residuals create direct paths for gradients, making learning stable.</p></li>
<li><p>Improving training speed: With residuals, deeper networks converge faster because the model can “skip” bad transformations while still using the identity mapping.</p></li>

<p>After embeddings, attention, MLPs, LayerNorm, and residuals have done their job, the model produces logits-raw scores for every word in the vocabulary at every position in the sequence. But logits alone don’t tell us if the model is “good” or “bad” at predicting the right word. To measure performance and guide learning, GPT-2 uses the cross-entropy loss function. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, this is implemented in the function <code>crossentropy_forward</code>.</p>

<pre><code>logits = [5.2, 1.1, -2.7]</code></pre>
<p>Logits are just numbers-bigger means “more likely,” smaller means “less likely”-but they aren’t probabilities yet.</p>

<p>Softmax has two important effects:</p>

<p>Cross-entropy compares the predicted probability for the correct word against the ideal case (probability = 1).</p>
<p>Formula:</p>
<pre><code>loss = -log(probability_of_correct_word)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If the model assigns high probability to the correct word, loss is small.</li>
<li>If the model assigns low probability, loss is large.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct word = Word 0, probability = 0.98 → loss = -log(0.98) ≈ 0.02 (excellent).</li>
<li>Correct word = Word 1, probability = 0.017 → loss = -log(0.017) ≈ 4.1 (bad).</li>

<p>Without subtracting <code>logit_max</code>, <code>exp(logits)</code> can overflow. For example, <code>exp(1000)</code> is infinite. By subtracting the max, the largest logit becomes 0, so its exponential is 1, and all others are ≤ 1. This keeps numbers manageable while preserving the probability ratios.</p>

<p>Cross-entropy loss turns raw model scores into a clear training signal. It penalizes wrong predictions, rewards confident correct ones, and ensures the optimizer knows exactly how to adjust weights. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, you see this implemented explicitly, without any library shortcuts-just loops, exponentials, and logs. Understanding this section is key to understanding how GPT-2 learns from its mistakes.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we’ve explored the forward pass piece by piece - embeddings, attention, feed-forward layers, layer normalization, residual connections, and finally the loss. But a model doesn’t live as disconnected pieces; they all come together in a single function that drives inference: <code>gpt2_forward</code>. This function is where the code actually executes the story we’ve been telling. Let’s walk through it carefully so you can see how every building block plugs into the whole picture.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-gpt2_forward" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-gpt2_forward">The role of <code>gpt2_forward</code></h4>
<p>Think of <code>gpt2_forward</code> as the director of the play. The actors (embeddings, attention, MLP, layernorm, etc.) already know their roles. The director calls them on stage in the right order and makes sure they hand the script off smoothly to the next actor. In our case:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tokens come in as integers (word IDs).</li>
<li>They’re turned into embeddings (token + position).</li>
<li>Each transformer block processes the sequence through attention, MLP, layernorm, and residuals.</li>

<section id="step-1-embedding-lookup" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-embedding-lookup">Step 1: Embedding lookup</h4>
<p>Before the model can reason about words, it has to map token IDs into continuous vectors. That’s where embedding tables come in:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>token_embedding</code> converts each integer token ID into a dense vector of size <code>C</code> (the channel dimension).</li>
<li><code>position_embedding</code> does the same for positions (0, 1, 2, …, T-1).</li>
<li>These two are added together, giving each token both a meaning (word identity) and a place in the sentence.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="step-2-transformer-blocks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-transformer-blocks">Step 2: Transformer blocks</h4>
<p>Each block is like a mini-pipeline that processes the sequence and passes it forward. Inside the loop:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Attention: compares tokens with each other, weighted by learned Q/K/V projections.</li>
<li>MLP: expands each token vector, applies a nonlinear GELU activation, then projects back down.</li>
<li>LayerNorm: normalizes values for stable training and inference.</li>
<li>Residual: adds the input of the block back to its output to keep information flowing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This loop runs <code>n_layer</code> times - for GPT-2 124M, that’s 12 blocks.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-final-normalization-and-logits" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-final-normalization-and-logits">Step 3: Final normalization and logits</h4>
<p>After the last block, the sequence of token representations goes through a final layer normalization. Then, a large matrix multiplication (<code>lm_head</code>) projects each token’s hidden state into the size of the vocabulary (≈50,000 for GPT-2). The result is a tensor of shape <code>(B, T, vocab_size)</code> containing the raw prediction scores for each next token.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-4-optional-loss-computation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-optional-loss-computation">Step 4: Optional loss computation</h4>
<p>If you pass <code>labels</code> (the correct next tokens) into <code>gpt2_forward</code>, the function calls <code>crossentropy_forward</code>. This compares the predicted scores with the true tokens and outputs a single number: the loss. The loss tells you “how wrong” the model was, which is critical during training. But if you’re only doing inference, you don’t need this step.</p>

<p>Understanding <code>gpt2_forward</code> gives you the complete mental picture of inference.

<ol type="1">
<li>Print shapes: Add <code>printf</code> statements inside <code>gpt2_forward</code> to print tensor shapes after embeddings, after each block, and after logits. This helps you see the data flow.</li>
<li>Use a single block: Change the loop to run only 1 transformer block instead of all 12. Watch how the outputs degrade - the model loses depth of reasoning.</li>
<li>Disable position embeddings: Comment out the line that adds <code>position_embedding</code>. Try running inference. You’ll notice the model becomes worse at handling word order.</li>
<li>Loss vs no loss: Call <code>gpt2_forward</code> with and without labels. Compare the difference - with labels you get a scalar loss, without labels you just get logits.</li>
<li>Smaller vocab: Try using a toy tokenizer with a small vocabulary and rerun the projection step. You’ll see the logits shrink to <code>(B, T, tiny_vocab_size)</code>.</li>

<p><code>gpt2_forward</code> is where GPT-2 inference really happens. It ties together every concept - embeddings, attention, feed-forward layers, normalization, residuals, and the final projection into vocabulary space. Once you understand this function, you don’t just know the pieces of GPT-2, you know how they actually work together to produce predictions. It’s the “main stage” of inference, and mastering it means you can confidently say you understand how a transformer runs forward on CPU.</p>

<p>CPU training in <code>train_gpt2.c</code> is intentionally “plain C,” but it still squeezes out a lot of speed by adding a few OpenMP pragmas (<code>#pragma omp …</code>) in the hottest loops. OpenMP lets the compiler split a loop’s iterations across multiple CPU cores-no threads to create by hand, no locks to manage. If you compile without OpenMP support, these pragmas are simply ignored and the code still runs (just slower).</p>

<p>A few key patterns to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collapse clauses (<code>collapse(2)</code> / <code>collapse(3)</code>) fuse nested loops into one big iteration space so the scheduler can distribute more, smaller chunks-great for load-balancing when <code>B</code>, <code>T</code>, or <code>NH</code> are modest.</li>
<li>Parallelizing along independent dimensions avoids race conditions. For example, in <code>matmul_backward</code> the pass that writes <code>dinp[b,t,:]</code> is parallelized over <code>(b,t)</code> so no two threads update the same memory.</li>
<li>Own-your-row strategy: when accumulating <code>dweight</code>, the loop goes over <code>o</code> (output channels) so each thread writes its own gradient row <code>dweight[o,:]</code>. No atomics needed.</li>

<p>When compiled with OpenMP, the compiler creates a team of threads and divides the iteration space (<code>B*T</code> in this example) among them. Each thread executes its assigned iterations; when the loop finishes, threads sync at an implicit barrier.</p>
<p>Because each <code>(b,t)</code> (or <code>(b,t,h)</code>) writes to a disjoint slice of the output arrays, there’s no need for locks or atomics. This is why these loops scale cleanly across cores.</p>

<li>Mind memory bandwidth. On wide CPUs, GEMMs may become bandwidth-bound. Bigger <code>B</code>/<code>T</code> improves arithmetic intensity; tiny batches underutilize cores.</li>
<li>Warm caches with tiling. The “tiled” <code>matmul_forward</code> keeps small accumulators in registers and reuses loaded weights across <code>LOOP_UNROLL</code> inner iterations.</li>
<li>Avoid hidden sharing. If you add new parallel loops, ensure each thread writes to unique memory regions. If you must accumulate to the same place, restructure (like “own-your-row”) or use per-thread scratch buffers then reduce.</li>

<p>A handful of well-placed OpenMP pragmas deliver big wins on CPU by parallelizing the most expensive loops (GEMMs, attention, softmax) across cores-without complicating the code. The design ensures each thread works on independent slices, so there’s no locking, no atomics, and very little overhead. If you compile with OpenMP enabled, you get fast, multi-core training; if not, you still have a clean, readable reference implementation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cpu-memory-footprint-and-performance">40. CPU Memory Footprint and Performance</h3>
<p>When you train GPT-2 on your CPU using <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, two big questions usually pop up almost immediately: <em>how much memory is this going to take?</em> and <em>how fast will it run?</em> Let’s walk through both of these in a beginner-friendly way, so you understand not just what happens in the code, but why it behaves the way it does.</p>
<section id="memory-where-does-it-all-go" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memory-where-does-it-all-go">Memory: where does it all go?</h4>
<p>Imagine training GPT-2 is like cooking a big meal in a small kitchen. You need space for ingredients, bowls for mixing, and counter space for preparing. Memory on your CPU is that kitchen. GPT-2 needs several “bowls” to hold different parts of the computation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Parameters (the weights of the model). These are the “fixed recipe” - the actual numbers the network learns. They come from the checkpoint file you load at the start. For GPT-2 124M, this is about 124 million floating-point numbers. Each one takes 4 bytes, so just the weights are around 500 MB.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimizer state (AdamW). Training doesn’t just adjust weights blindly; it keeps track of two extra moving averages for each weight, called <em>m</em> and <em>v</em>. That means for every single parameter, you store three numbers: the weight, m, and v. So memory for optimizer state is often double the size of the weights themselves. For GPT-2 124M, that’s about 1 GB more.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradients. Every time we run a backward pass, we store how much each weight should change. That’s another buffer roughly the same size as the weights - another 500 MB.</p></li>
<li><p>Activations (intermediate results). This is the sneaky one. Every forward pass produces temporary tensors like embeddings, attention maps, and feed-forward outputs. Their size depends on batch size (B) and sequence length (T). If B=4 and T=64, activations are a few hundred MB. If B=32 and T=1024, they can balloon to many gigabytes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a rough mental budget for GPT-2 124M with a small setup (B=4, T=64):</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters: ~500 MB</li>
<li>Optimizer state: ~1 GB</li>
<li>Gradients: ~500 MB</li>
<li>Activations: ~200–300 MB Total: ~2–2.5 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for the “tiny” GPT-2, you already need a couple gigabytes of RAM to train. On a laptop, this can quickly push you to the limit.</p>
</section>
<section id="performance-where-does-time-go" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-where-does-time-go">Performance: where does time go?</h4>
<p>Now let’s talk speed. When you run <code>train_gpt2.c</code> on CPU, you’ll see lines like:</p>
<pre><code>step 1: train loss 5.191576 (took 1927.230000 ms)</code></pre>
<p>That “took X ms” tells you how long one step took. Why is it slow? Three main reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Matrix multiplications (matmuls). These are the heart of neural networks. Every attention head and every MLP layer does them. On CPU, most of your step time is spent here. That’s why the code uses OpenMP pragmas (<code>#pragma omp</code>) to parallelize loops across cores.</p></li>
<li><p>Attention softmax. Attention compares every token in a sequence with every other token. If your sequence length is 1024, that’s over a million comparisons per head per layer. On CPU, this quadratic growth is painful.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory bandwidth. CPUs can only move numbers from RAM to cores so fast. Even if you had infinite FLOPs, you’d still be slowed down by how quickly you can fetch and store these huge tensors.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="a-simple-experiment" class="level4">

<p>You can see these effects yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change batch size (B). Run with B=1, then with B=8. Notice how memory usage and step time scale up.</li>
<li>Change sequence length (T). Try T=16, then T=256. You’ll see attention costs grow dramatically.</li>
<li>Change threads. Set <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS=1</code> versus <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS=8</code>. With more threads, you’ll often see speedups, but only up to the number of physical cores your CPU has.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="why-this-matters-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h4>
<p>For beginners, CPU runs are perfect for learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can debug with small batches and short sequences.</li>
<li>You can step into functions with a debugger and watch tensors being created.</li>
<li>You don’t need a GPU just to understand how training works.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when it comes to <em>serious</em> training - larger GPT-2 models or even long sequences - CPU is simply too slow. What takes seconds on GPU may take minutes on CPU. That’s why in practice, people use CPUs for learning and testing, and GPUs for large-scale training.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-takeaway-29" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-29">The takeaway</h4>
<p>Training GPT-2 on CPU is like practicing piano on a small keyboard. It’s slower, limited, and you can’t play the biggest pieces, but it’s great for learning the fundamentals. Memory usage comes from weights, optimizer state, gradients, and activations, and performance is dominated by matmuls and attention. Once you understand where the resources go, you can adjust batch size, sequence length, and threads to find the sweet spot for your machine.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backward-pass-walkthrough">41. Backward Pass Walkthrough</h3>
<p>Up until now, we’ve spent all our time looking at the forward pass. That’s the part of the model that takes tokens, pushes them through embeddings, attention, feed-forward layers, and finally produces logits or a loss. For inference, forward pass alone is enough. But if you want to train a model, forward is only half the story.</p>
<p>Training means adjusting the weights of the model so that its predictions become better over time. To do this, we need a way to figure out how wrong each weight was and in what direction it should move to reduce the loss. That’s the job of the backward pass.</p>
<p>The backward pass is also called backpropagation. It’s the algorithm that moves information in reverse through the network: from the loss, back through the final logits, through every transformer block, down to the embeddings. Along the way, it calculates gradients - small numbers that tell us how much each weight contributed to the error.</p>
<section id="the-big-idea-chain-rule-in-action" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-big-idea-chain-rule-in-action">The big idea: chain rule in action</h4>
<p>At the heart of backpropagation is something very familiar from calculus: the chain rule. If the output of the network depends on many functions stacked together (embedding → attention → MLP → … → loss), then the derivative of the loss with respect to an early parameter is a product of partial derivatives through the entire chain.</p>
<p>Instead of writing long formulas, the code in <code>train_gpt2.c</code> simply calls each layer’s backward function in reverse order. The gradient flows backward, step by step, and each layer computes its own contribution using local rules.</p>
<p>Think of it like a relay race, but run backwards: the loss hands a “blame baton” to the output head, which hands it back to the last transformer block, and so on, until it reaches the very first embedding table.</p>

<p>Here comes the heavy lifting. Each block has multiple components, and their backward functions are called in the exact opposite order of the forward pass.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Residual backward: the skip connection splits the gradient into two paths - one flowing back into the transformed output, one flowing back into the original input.</li>
<li>LayerNorm backward: computes gradients with respect to its scale (<code>gamma</code>) and shift (<code>beta</code>), and also passes gradients back to the normalized input.</li>
<li>MLP backward: applies the chain rule to the two linear layers and the GELU activation. The code reuses temporary values from the forward pass (like activations) to make this efficient.</li>
<li>Attention backward: this is the trickiest. It computes gradients for Q, K, and V projections, as well as for the softmaxed attention weights. It has to apply the causal mask again to ensure no illegal gradient flows.</li>
</ol>
<p>This loop continues until all transformer blocks have been processed.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-back-to-embeddings">Step 4: Back to embeddings</h4>
<p>Finally, the gradient reaches the embedding tables. This is where the model first looked up vectors for tokens and positions. Now it calculates how much each embedding contributed to the error. These gradients are added into the embedding matrices, telling the optimizer how to update them.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters-3">Why this matters</h4>
<p>The backward pass is what makes learning possible. Without it, the model would forever output the same predictions, never improving. By flowing “blame” backwards, each parameter learns how to nudge itself so that the next forward pass is a little bit better.</p>
<p>Even though the code looks like a lot of function calls, the principle is simple: start from the loss, step backward through each layer, apply the chain rule locally, and collect gradients.</p>

<li>Inspect embeddings: After training a few steps, dump a few rows of the token embedding matrix. You’ll see the numbers changing because of gradient updates.</li>
<li>Tiny dataset experiment: Train on a very small dataset (like a 10-word corpus) and watch how the backward pass quickly pushes embeddings to memorize it.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-30">The takeaway</h4>
<p>Backpropagation is the learning engine of neural networks. In <code>llm.c</code>, the backward pass is written out explicitly, showing how gradients flow from the loss, through the output head, back through every transformer block, and finally into embeddings. Once you understand this flow, you can see how training stitches forward and backward together to slowly shape a random model into a working language model.</p>

<section id="skeleton-of-training-loop" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skeleton-of-training-loop">42. Skeleton of Training Loop</h3>
<p>The backward pass gave us gradients, but gradients by themselves don’t train a model. Training requires a loop: a cycle that repeatedly runs forward, backward, and update steps over and over until the model improves. This cycle is called the training loop, and it is the heartbeat of every deep learning program. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, the loop is written explicitly in C, which means you can see every piece instead of it being hidden away in a framework.</p>
<section id="the-basic-rhythm" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-basic-rhythm">The basic rhythm</h4>
<p>Every training step follows the same rhythm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a batch of data (input tokens and their labels).</li>
<li>Run the forward pass to compute predictions and loss.</li>
<li>Run the backward pass to compute gradients.</li>
<li>Update weights using an optimizer like AdamW.</li>
<li>Log progress and, occasionally, validate.</li>
</ol>
<p>This rhythm repeats thousands or millions of times. With each repetition, the weights shift slightly, nudging the model toward lower loss and better predictions.</p>

<p>The dataloader feeds the loop with small chunks of tokens. Instead of sending the whole dataset at once, it breaks it down into batches of size <code>B</code> (number of sequences per batch) and length <code>T</code> (number of tokens per sequence).</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: if <code>B=4</code> and <code>T=128</code>, each batch is 512 tokens long.</li>
<li>Each sequence has a matching set of labels, which are simply the same tokens shifted one position ahead (so the model always predicts the <em>next</em> word).</li>
</ul>
<p>This batching keeps memory use manageable and helps the model see many small samples instead of a few giant ones.</p>

<section id="step-2-forward-pass" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-forward-pass">Step 2: Forward pass</h4>

<p>Every few hundred or thousand steps, the loop also runs a validation pass on held-out data. This tells you whether the model is just memorizing training data or genuinely learning patterns that generalize.</p>

<p>The training loop is deceptively simple, but it is the engine room of machine learning. Every improvement in model performance happens because this loop runs many times. By writing it explicitly in C, <code>llm.c</code> exposes details that high-level frameworks usually hide: zeroing gradients, passing pointers to arrays, calling backward and optimizer functions directly.</p>
<p>This makes it a perfect learning tool. You can see clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the data comes in,</li>
<li>Where predictions are made,</li>
<li>Where gradients are calculated,</li>
<li>And where learning actually happens.</li>

<li>Print the loss curve: Add a <code>printf</code> inside the loop and write the loss to a file. Plot it - you should see it decrease over time.</li>
<li>Change batch size: Set <code>B=1</code> vs.&nbsp;<code>B=8</code>. Notice how the loop becomes noisier with smaller batches but smoother with larger ones.</li>
<li>Skip backward: Comment out <code>gpt2_backward</code> and optimizer update. Run the loop. You’ll see the loss never decreases - a clear demonstration that forward alone doesn’t train.</li>
<li>Experiment with steps: Try <code>max_steps=10</code> vs.&nbsp;<code>max_steps=1000</code>. Short runs show no improvement; longer runs start to reduce the loss.</li>
<li>Slow it down: Insert a <code>sleep(1);</code> inside the loop. This makes the rhythm visible step by step, so you can literally watch the model “breathe” as it trains.</li>

<p>The skeleton of the training loop is the core cycle of learning. It feeds data into the model, computes predictions, finds errors, sends them backward, updates weights, and logs progress. Everything else - optimizers, schedulers, distributed training, mixed precision - is just an enhancement of this basic loop.

<section id="adamw-implementation-in-c" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adamw-implementation-in-c">43. AdamW Implementation in C</h3>
<p>Training a neural network is about adjusting millions of parameters so that the model gradually becomes better at predicting text. The function <code>gpt2_update</code> in <code>train_gpt2.c</code> is responsible for this adjustment. It implements the AdamW optimizer, one of the most widely used algorithms in deep learning. Let’s walk through both the theory and the actual implementation.</p>
<section id="from-gradient-descent-to-adamw" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-gradient-descent-to-adamw">From Gradient Descent to AdamW</h4>
<p>The most basic optimizer is gradient descent:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>new_param = old_param - learning_rate * gradient</code></pre>
<p>This approach works, but it has weaknesses. The step size (learning rate) must be tuned carefully: too small and training is slow, too large and training diverges. Moreover, all parameters use the same step size, even though some may need gentler updates.</p>
<p>AdamW improves this by keeping track of moving averages of gradients and scaling updates adaptively. It also introduces weight decay, which prevents parameters from growing too large and helps regularize the model.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-adamw-works" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-adamw-works">How AdamW Works</h4>
<p>AdamW combines several techniques into a single update rule. First, it uses momentum: instead of relying only on the current gradient, it averages recent gradients. This smooths noisy updates. Second, it maintains a running estimate of the squared gradient, which scales down steps in directions where gradients are consistently large. These are sometimes called the first and second moments.</p>
<p>Since both running averages start at zero, the algorithm applies bias correction during the first few steps. Without this, the early updates would be too small. Finally, AdamW applies weight decay directly in the update, shrinking parameter values slightly each step.</p>
<p>Putting it together, each parameter update looks like this:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>m_t = β1 * m_(t-1) + (1 - β1) * g_t
v_t = β2 * v_(t-1) + (1 - β2) * g_t²
m̂_t = m_t / (1 - β1^t)
v̂_t = v_t / (1 - β2^t)

new_param = old_param - lr * ( m̂_t / (sqrt(v̂_t) + ε) + λ * old_param )</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>m</code> is momentum, <code>v</code> is variance, <code>lr</code> is learning rate, <code>ε</code> is a small constant for stability, and <code>λ</code> is the weight decay factor.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a parameter <code>w = 0.5</code> with gradient <code>g = 0.2</code> on the first training step. Using β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Momentum:</p>
<pre><code>m = 0.9 * 0 + 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Variance:</p>
<pre><code>v = 0.999 * 0 + 0.001 * 0.04 = 0.00004</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Bias correction:</p>
<pre><code>m̂ = 0.02 / (1 - 0.9) = 0.2
v̂ = 0.00004 / (1 - 0.999) = 0.04</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Final update (lr = 0.001, weight_decay = 0.01):</p>
<pre><code>update = 0.001 * (0.2 / sqrt(0.04) + 0.01 * 0.5)
       = 0.001 * (1.0 + 0.005)
       = 0.001005</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>So the parameter becomes <code>w = 0.498995</code>.</p>

<p>Think of a ball rolling down a slope. The gradient is the slope itself. Momentum makes the ball keep rolling even if the slope flattens briefly. The variance term makes the ball slow down on rocky ground where the slope changes rapidly. Bias correction ensures the ball doesn’t move too timidly at the start. Weight decay adds friction so the ball doesn’t roll out of control.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-26">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>Optimizers are the difference between a model that trains smoothly and one that diverges or gets stuck. AdamW became popular because it combines stability with efficiency. It automatically adapts to each parameter’s scale, reduces the need for manual learning rate tuning, and includes weight decay in a principled way. For GPT-style models with hundreds of millions of parameters, these qualities make training feasible.</p>

<p>AdamW provides a balance of speed, stability, and generalization. In practice, it allows models like GPT-2 to train much more reliably than with vanilla gradient descent. The C implementation in <code>llm.c</code> demonstrates that beneath the math, it’s just a simple loop applying a few arithmetic operations for each parameter.</p>

<section id="gradient-accumulation-and-micro-batching" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gradient-accumulation-and-micro-batching">44. Gradient Accumulation and Micro-Batching</h3>
<p>Modern language models are enormous, and so are the batches of text we would like to feed them during training. But real hardware has limits: a single GPU or CPU may not have enough memory to process a large batch in one go. To solve this, training code often uses gradient accumulation and micro-batching. Both ideas allow us to simulate training with larger batches without requiring more memory than our hardware can provide.</p>
<section id="what-problem-are-we-solving" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-problem-are-we-solving">What Problem Are We Solving?</h4>
<p>When you process a batch of data, you run forward and backward passes to calculate gradients. If your batch size is very large, you get smoother gradients (less noisy), which often helps the model converge better. But large batches may not fit in memory.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to train with a batch of 1024 sequences on a GPU that can only handle 128 sequences at once. Without tricks, you would be forced to use the smaller batch size and give up the benefits of larger batches. Gradient accumulation fixes this problem by letting you split the big batch into smaller micro-batches, process them one at a time, and accumulate the results as if you had processed the big batch all at once.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-it-works-in-practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-works-in-practice">How It Works in Practice</h4>
<p>Let’s say we want an effective batch size of 1024, but our hardware only supports 128. We split the big batch into 8 micro-batches of 128 each:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run forward + backward on micro-batch 1, store the gradients.</li>
<li>Run forward + backward on micro-batch 2, add its gradients to the stored ones.</li>
<li>Repeat until all 8 micro-batches are processed.</li>
<li>Once gradients for all 8 are accumulated, perform the optimizer update.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important part is step 4: we only update the parameters once per effective batch, not after each micro-batch. This preserves the effect of training with a large batch.</p>

<p>Gradient accumulation and micro-batching are techniques that let you train with large effective batch sizes while staying within the limits of your hardware.

This is a small adjustment in code but a huge enabler in practice.</p>

<p>When you train a model, it is not enough to look only at how well it does on the training data. The real test is whether the model has learned patterns that apply to new, unseen data. This is where validation comes in. Validation is like a quiz the model takes from time to time during training. It does not count toward learning-it is just a check to see how much the model has really understood.</p>
<p>In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, validation is built right into the training loop. Every so often, instead of updating weights, the program pauses and runs the model on a set of tokens it has never trained on. It then prints out the average validation loss. This number tells you if the model is actually generalizing, not just memorizing.</p>

<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb116"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb116-1"><a href="#cb116-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(</span>step <span class="op">%</span> <span class="dv">10</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This means that validation happens every 10 steps. The <code>%</code> operator is “modulo,” which returns the remainder of a division. If the step number is divisible by 10 (like 0, 10, 20, 30), then the block runs. By spacing it out this way, validation does not slow training too much but still gives you regular updates.</p>
<p>Next, the code sets up a place to store the running total of the validation loss:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb117"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb117-1"><a href="#cb117-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">float</span> val_loss <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">0.0</span><span class="bu">f</span><span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>Then it resets the validation dataloader:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb118"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb118-1"><a href="#cb118-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dataloader_reset<span class="op">(&amp;</span>val_loader<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This makes sure the validation dataset starts from the beginning each time. That way, the results are consistent-you’re always checking the model on the same set of text, rather than starting from a random place.</p>
<p>Now comes the loop over validation batches:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb119"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb119-1"><a href="#cb119-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">int</span> i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> val_num_batches<span class="op">;</span> i<span class="op">++)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>

<span id="cb119-4"><a href="#cb119-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    val_loss <span class="op">+=</span> model<span class="op">.</span>mean_loss<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb119-5"><a href="#cb119-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>Here’s what’s happening inside:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dataloader_next_batch</code> fetches the next chunk of tokens and labels from the validation set.</li>
<li><code>gpt2_forward</code> runs the model forward on those tokens, predicting the next word for each one, and computes the loss against the true labels.</li>
<li>The loss from that batch is added to <code>val_loss</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that there is no call to <code>gpt2_zero_grad</code>, no <code>gpt2_backward</code>, and no <code>gpt2_update</code>. That is because validation does not train the model. It only measures performance.</p>
<p>Finally, the program averages the loss across the number of batches:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb120"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb120-1"><a href="#cb120-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>val_loss <span class="op">/=</span> val_num_batches<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>And prints the result:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb121"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb121-1"><a href="#cb121-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>printf<span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"val loss </span><span class="sc">%f\n</span><span class="st">"</span><span class="op">,</span> val_loss<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>This gives you a single number that summarizes how well the model is performing on unseen data at this point in training.</p>

<section id="how-to-read-validation-loss" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-read-validation-loss">How to read validation loss</h4>
<p>Imagine you are training and see logs like this:</p>
<pre><code>step 0: train loss 4.677779 (took 1987.546 ms)
val loss 4.901234
step 1: train loss 5.191576 (took 1927.230 ms)
step 2: train loss 4.438685 (took 1902.987 ms)
...
step 10: train loss 3.912342 (took 1890.321 ms)
val loss 4.100321</code></pre>
<p>The training loss is printed every step, while the validation loss appears every 10 steps. If both numbers are going down, that is a sign the model is genuinely learning. If training loss drops but validation loss stays the same or starts going up, the model is probably memorizing the training set-this is called overfitting.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-validation-is-important" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-validation-is-important">Why validation is important</h4>
<p>Without validation, you could be tricked into thinking the model is improving just because the training loss is going down. But that might only mean it has memorized the training data. Validation checks prevent this by showing you whether the model can handle data it has not seen before. It is like a student practicing with old exam papers (training) versus being tested with new problems (validation).</p>
</section>
<section id="small-details-that-matter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="small-details-that-matter">Small details that matter</h4>
<p>The code averages validation loss over <code>val_num_batches</code>, which is set earlier to 5. That means it only checks 5 batches, not the entire validation dataset. This is a shortcut-it makes validation much faster, at the cost of some accuracy in the measurement. But for training feedback, this is usually enough.</p>
<p>The batch size <code>B</code> and sequence length <code>T</code> for validation are the same as training. This keeps the loss comparable between training and validation.</p>

<section id="try-it-yourself-34" class="level4">

<p>You can experiment with the validation process to understand it better. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change the frequency from every 10 steps to every 5 or even every step. You’ll see more validation updates, but training will slow down.</li>
<li>Increase <code>val_num_batches</code> to 20. The validation loss will become less noisy, but each check will take longer.</li>
<li>Comment out the validation block and train again. Notice how you lose a sense of whether the model is really generalizing.</li>
<li>Save validation loss values to a file and plot them. Compare the curve against the training loss curve. You’ll see how they move together or diverge.</li>
<li>Try using a very small validation dataset. Watch how the loss jumps around more compared to a larger, more stable dataset.</li>
</ol>

<section id="the-takeaway-35" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-35">The takeaway</h4>
<p>Validation runs are short forward-only tests that give you confidence the model is learning patterns that apply to new text. They are easy to implement-a few lines of code in <code>train_gpt2.c</code>-but they are one of the most important tools for monitoring training. By checking validation loss regularly, you make sure your model is not just memorizing but actually becoming better at language modeling.</p>

<p>Training a model can take hours, days, or even weeks. If you stop the program halfway-whether by accident (a crash, a power cut) or on purpose (pausing to save compute)-you don’t want to start over from scratch. Checkpointing solves this problem by saving the model’s parameters and optimizer state to disk so you can resume training later.</p>
<section id="what-a-checkpoint-contains" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-a-checkpoint-contains">What a checkpoint contains</h4>
<p>A checkpoint is like a “save game” for machine learning. At a minimum, it needs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Model parameters – the actual weights of the neural network, stored as floating-point numbers in memory. These define what the model has learned so far.</li>
<li>Optimizer state – for AdamW, this includes the running averages of gradients (<code>m_memory</code>) and squared gradients (<code>v_memory</code>). Without these, the optimizer would lose its “memory” of past updates, which could destabilize resumed training.</li>
<li>Step counter – the number of steps completed so far. This matters for bias correction in AdamW and for scheduling the learning rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these three things capture the full training state.</p>

<p>It might seem enough to save only the model’s parameters. But AdamW depends on moving averages of past gradients. If you throw those away and restart with only the parameters, the optimizer will behave differently. Learning may suddenly become unstable, or the effective learning rate may feel wrong. That’s why saving both the parameters and optimizer state gives the most faithful restart.</p>

<p>Training is rarely smooth. Servers reboot, experiments are interrupted, bugs are found. Without checkpoints, any interruption means wasted compute and lost progress. With checkpoints, you can pause and resume at will. They also let you archive important moments in training-for example, saving the model when validation loss is lowest, not just at the end.</p>

<p>Checkpointing is what makes long-running training practical. By saving parameters, optimizer state, and the step counter, you preserve not just what the model knows but how it is learning. In real projects, checkpoints are the bridge between experiments and production: they let you stop, resume, compare, and deploy models without ever starting from scratch. Even though <code>llm.c</code> does not fully implement it, the concept is simple and invaluable.</p>

<section id="reproducibility-and-small-divergences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility-and-small-divergences">48. Reproducibility and Small Divergences</h3>
<p>When training deep learning models, two runs that look identical on the surface can still behave differently. One run might converge quickly, another might take longer, and sometimes losses diverge even though you used the same dataset and code. This happens because of the way randomness and numerical precision interact during training. Reproducibility is about controlling these factors so that results are consistent and meaningful.</p>
<section id="sources-of-randomness" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sources-of-randomness">Sources of randomness</h4>
<p>There are several places where randomness sneaks into training:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data order: if batches are shuffled differently, the model sees tokens in a new sequence. Early steps can influence the trajectory of training.</li>
<li>Weight initialization: initial parameters are usually set randomly. Different seeds lead to slightly different starting points.</li>
<li>Dropout and sampling: while <code>train_gpt2.c</code> is minimal and doesn’t include dropout layers, many neural networks do. Dropout randomly disables activations during training.</li>
<li>Floating-point arithmetic: on CPUs and GPUs, the order of summations or parallel reductions can cause tiny rounding differences. Over many steps, these small changes accumulate.</li>
</ul>

<section id="how-llm.c-handles-reproducibility" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-llm.c-handles-reproducibility">How llm.c handles reproducibility</h4>
<p>The repository includes functions like <code>manual_seed</code> and <code>random_f32</code> in <code>llmc/rand.h</code>. These are simple random number generators that can be seeded with a fixed value. For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb125"><pre class="sourceCode c code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb125-1"><a href="#cb125-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>manual_seed<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">1337</span><span class="op">);</span>  </span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<p>If you call this before training, the random number generator starts from the same state every run. That means weight initialization and sampling will be reproducible.</p>
<p>The dataloaders also have reproducibility options. When you initialize a <code>DataLoader</code>, you can decide whether it shuffles batches or not. Keeping this consistent ensures the model sees the same data order each run.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-small-divergences-happen-anyway" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-small-divergences-happen-anyway">Why small divergences happen anyway</h4>
<p>Even with fixed seeds, you might notice that two runs are not perfectly identical. On CPUs, differences often come from OpenMP parallel loops-threads may sum numbers in a different order, producing slightly different results. On GPUs, parallelism and library implementations (like cuBLAS or cuDNN) can do the same.</p>
<p>These differences are usually very small, but deep learning systems are chaotic: tiny changes in the early steps can grow into visible differences later. This doesn’t mean the code is wrong-it just means floating-point math has limits.</p>

<section id="why-reproducibility-matters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-reproducibility-matters">Why reproducibility matters</h4>
<p>Reproducibility isn’t just about peace of mind. It has real uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging: if a bug appears, you want to reproduce the exact same run to diagnose it.</li>
<li>Comparisons: when testing new optimizers, schedulers, or architectures, you want fair comparisons on identical conditions.</li>
<li>Science: reproducible results are essential for research papers and benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, absolute bit-for-bit reproducibility is often unrealistic in large parallel systems. Instead, the goal is practical reproducibility: ensuring that runs are <em>similar enough</em> to reach the same conclusions.</p>

<section id="example-experiment" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-experiment">Example experiment</h4>
<p>Suppose you seed training with <code>manual_seed(1337)</code> and use the same dataset. You might get a loss curve like this:</p>

Run B: step 1000 → val loss 3.43  </code></pre>
<p>The numbers are not identical, but they are close. The important part is that the model’s learning trajectory is stable and results are comparable.</p>
<p>If you remove the seed and allow full randomness, you might get:</p>
<pre><code>Run A: step 1000 → val loss 3.42  
Run B: step 1000 → val loss 3.89  </code></pre>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="command-line-flags-and-defaults">49. Command-Line Flags and Defaults</h3>
<p>When you run a training program, you often want to change certain settings without editing the source code. For example, you might want to try a different batch size, adjust the learning rate, or train for more steps. Command-line flags make this possible. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, defaults are set inside the program, but it can also be compiled to accept arguments, giving you flexibility while keeping the code minimal.</p>
<section id="why-flags-exist" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-flags-exist">Why flags exist</h4>
<p>Deep learning experiments are highly sensitive to hyperparameters-values like learning rate, batch size, sequence length, or number of steps. If every change required modifying source code, recompiling, and rerunning, experimentation would be slow and error-prone. Flags allow you to configure these parameters quickly at runtime.</p>
<p>In many large frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow), command-line arguments are parsed with helper libraries. In <code>llm.c</code>, the philosophy is simplicity: flags are either defined in code as constants, or you can extend <code>main</code> with standard C argument parsing to override defaults.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to understand what a training loop is doing is by reading its logs. Logs are the program’s way of telling you how training is progressing: what the loss is, how fast it’s running, and whether validation checks are improving. In <code>train_gpt2.c</code>, logging is deliberately minimal so you can easily see the essentials without being overwhelmed.</p>
<section id="what-the-logs-look-like" class="level4">

<p>Each part of this output has meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataset sizes: how many training and validation batches are available.</li>
<li>Model config: confirmation that the GPT-2 model was loaded correctly (sequence length, vocab size, number of layers, etc.).</li>
<li>Validation loss: an average measure of how well the model is doing on unseen data.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="debug-state-structs-and-their-role">51. Debug State Structs and Their Role</h3>
<p>When building and training a model as complex as GPT-2, you need ways to peek inside and check whether the values being passed around make sense. This is where debug state structs come in. In <em>llm.c</em>, the code is written in plain C, without the rich debugging utilities of frameworks like PyTorch. That means the developers had to create their own mechanism to store, inspect, and compare intermediate values.</p>
<p>A struct in C is just a container that groups related variables together. For debugging, you can think of a struct as a little notebook where the program writes down numbers as it computes them. These numbers might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The raw embeddings for tokens.</li>
<li>The attention scores before and after softmax.</li>
<li>The outputs of each MLP block.</li>
<li>The predicted probabilities for the next token.</li>
</ul>
<p>By saving these into a structured format, the program can later compare them to the outputs of a trusted reference implementation (usually PyTorch).</p>
<section id="how-it-works-in-practice-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-works-in-practice-1">How it works in practice</h4>
<p>Inside <em>llm.c</em>, there are places where arrays of floats—like hidden states or logits—are copied into a debug state struct. Once stored, these values can be printed, dumped to a file, or checked against “golden” results from PyTorch.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re testing a tiny batch of input tokens. The forward pass runs as usual, but at specific checkpoints (say, right after attention or after the final linear projection), the program writes those arrays into a struct. Later, when running a PyTorch model with the same inputs and weights, the two outputs can be compared element by element.</p>
<p>This is essential for catching subtle errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A misplaced transpose in matrix multiplication.</li>
<li>Forgetting to apply a mask in attention.</li>
<li>A floating-point precision mismatch in softmax.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without the struct, you’d only know the model loss looks “off.” With the struct, you know <em>exactly</em> which step went wrong.</p>

<p>Debug structs bridge the gap between C and Python ecosystems. PyTorch has a decade of battle-tested layers, so it’s the gold standard for correctness. By saving intermediate activations in C and comparing them against PyTorch, developers ensure that every layer behaves identically. This builds confidence that the <em>llm.c</em> codebase isn’t just “roughly correct,” but precisely reproduces GPT-2’s math.</p>
<p>For anyone modifying the code—for example, writing a new activation function or experimenting with quantization—the debug structs act like a safety net. You can quickly see if your change accidentally altered the outputs in a way that breaks parity with the original model.</p>

<p>Testing is one of the most important parts of the <em>llm.c</em> project. The file <code>test_gpt2.c</code> exists specifically to check whether the C implementation of GPT-2 produces the same outputs as PyTorch, which is the trusted reference. Without this file, you would only know if the final training loss looked reasonable. With it, you can verify that every part of the forward pass matches.</p>
<p>At its core, <code>test_gpt2.c</code> runs a very controlled experiment: it loads a GPT-2 model checkpoint (exported from PyTorch), prepares a small batch of input tokens, executes a forward pass in C, and compares the outputs against the corresponding tensors from PyTorch. If everything matches within a tight numerical tolerance, you know the C code is correct. If not, you have a clear signal that something is wrong.</p>

<li><p>Load the checkpoint The test begins by reading a binary checkpoint file, such as <code>gpt2_124M.bin</code>, which contains the weights of the GPT-2 model. These weights were originally trained in PyTorch and then exported into a binary format that <em>llm.c</em> can understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare the inputs The test uses a known sequence of token IDs—sometimes from a dataset like Tiny Shakespeare, sometimes just a few hand-picked tokens. This ensures the same inputs can be run through both PyTorch and C implementations.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the C forward pass The function <code>gpt2_forward</code> is executed on the CPU. All embeddings, attention layers, MLPs, and final logits are computed exactly as they would be during real inference or training.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare with PyTorch For each major tensor (e.g., hidden states, attention outputs, final logits), the values are compared against saved outputs from PyTorch. The comparison usually allows for very small differences, since floating-point math can vary slightly between libraries. A tolerance like <code>1e-5</code> is common.</p></li>

<p>C code is low-level and unforgiving. A single indexing mistake, a wrong stride, or a missing scaling factor in attention can make outputs diverge wildly. Since GPT-2 has millions of parameters, such errors are almost impossible to spot by hand. By tying the implementation back to PyTorch, <code>test_gpt2.c</code> provides a ground truth check.</p>
<p>This also ensures scientific reproducibility. If someone else downloads <em>llm.c</em> and runs <code>test_gpt2.c</code>, they should see the same level of agreement with PyTorch. That way, they can trust that training runs, losses, and model outputs are not artifacts of a broken implementation.</p>

<p>Once you have a test like <code>test_gpt2.c</code> set up, the next challenge is figuring out how close the outputs need to be for the test to pass. Computers don’t always produce bit-for-bit identical results when doing floating-point math. The order of operations, the precision of instructions, and even the type of hardware (CPU vs GPU) can cause tiny differences.</p>
<p>If you demanded exact matches, most tests would fail even when the implementation is correct. That’s why <em>llm.c</em> uses tolerance-based comparison. Instead of asking “are these numbers exactly equal?”, the code asks “are these numbers <em>close enough</em>?”</p>
<section id="absolute-vs-relative-tolerance" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="absolute-vs-relative-tolerance">Absolute vs relative tolerance</h4>
<p>There are two common ways to define “close enough”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Absolute tolerance: check that the difference between two numbers is smaller than a threshold. For example,</p>
<pre><code>|0.123456 - 0.123455| = 0.000001 &lt; 1e-5</code></pre>
<p>This works well for values near zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Relative tolerance: check that the difference is small relative to the size of the numbers. For example,</p>
<pre><code>|1000.0 - 1000.1| / 1000.0 = 0.0001</code></pre>
<p>Even though the absolute difference is 0.1, that’s tiny compared to the scale of 1000.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the code often combines both. It passes if the difference is smaller than either the absolute tolerance or the relative tolerance.</p>

<p>Suppose you compare the probabilities after softmax. You might get:</p>

<p>Profiling is the act of measuring the performance of a program, not just its correctness. Instead of asking “does this number match PyTorch?”, profiling asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many milliseconds does one forward pass take?</li>
<li>Which part of the model consumes the most time?</li>

<p>When talking about performance in deep learning, it’s not enough to say “this run took 200 milliseconds.” To really understand efficiency, we need a measure that’s independent of hardware and input size. That’s where FLOPs come in: floating-point operations. A FLOP is a single numerical calculation involving real numbers—like an addition, multiplication, or division.</p>
<p>By counting how many FLOPs a model requires and comparing it to how many the computer can perform per second, you can evaluate how close your implementation is to the theoretical maximum speed of your CPU.</p>
<section id="what-flops-mean-in-practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-flops-mean-in-practice">What FLOPs mean in practice</h4>
<p>Every layer of GPT-2—embeddings, attention, feed-forward—can be broken down into a sequence of multiplications and additions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A matrix multiplication between two matrices of size <code>M × K</code> and <code>K × N</code> requires <code>2 × M × K × N</code> FLOPs.</li>
<li>A softmax across a vector of size <code>d</code> requires about <code>3d</code> FLOPs (exponentials, sums, and divisions).</li>
<li>An MLP block with hidden size <code>h</code> and intermediate size <code>4h</code> requires multiple matrix multiplications, adding up to billions of FLOPs per training step.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you sum these across all layers, even a small GPT-2 model like 124M parameters involves several gigaFLOPs (billions of operations) for one forward pass.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-consumes-memory-in-gpt-2">What consumes memory in GPT-2</h4>
<p>There are several key components that take up space:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Parameters (weights): GPT-2 124M has about 124 million parameters. Each is stored as a 32-bit float (4 bytes). That alone is roughly 500 MB.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradients: During training, gradients for each parameter are stored. That doubles the memory usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimizer states: AdamW requires two additional memory slots per parameter (<code>m</code> and <code>v</code>), which doubles it again. With parameters, gradients, and optimizer states combined, training can require 4× the parameter size in memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Activations: These are the intermediate outputs of each layer (attention scores, MLP results, normalized states). For backpropagation, activations from the forward pass must be kept until gradients are computed. Depending on batch size and sequence length, activations can rival parameter memory.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="measuring-memory-in-practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-memory-in-practice">Measuring memory in practice</h4>
<p>On CPU, memory usage can be inspected in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system tools: <code>top</code>, <code>htop</code>, or Activity Monitor show total memory used by the program.</li>
<li>Manual accounting in code: <em>llm.c</em> knows how many parameters, gradients, and optimizer states exist. By multiplying their counts by 4 bytes, it can estimate usage precisely.</li>
<li>Instrumentation during profiling: you can add checkpoints that print memory usage at different stages of the forward or backward pass.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters only: ~500 MB.</li>
<li>Parameters + gradients: ~1 GB.</li>

<li>Adding activations: 2.5–3 GB, depending on batch size and sequence length.</li>

<p>On a CPU, you don’t just care about “can it fit in RAM?” You also care about cache efficiency. Modern CPUs have multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3), which are much faster than main RAM. If activations or weights don’t fit well in cache, performance can suffer even if you technically have enough RAM.</p>
<p>Memory footprint also limits experiment flexibility. For example, increasing sequence length from 64 to 1024 multiplies activation storage by 16. A run that fits at <code>T=64</code> may crash or swap at <code>T=1024</code>.</p>

By anticipating where NaNs and Infs can arise, adding checks, and applying stabilizing tricks, you make <em>llm.c</em> robust. This ensures that experiments are reliable and that debugging focuses on real algorithmic issues rather than avoidable numerical traps.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-unit-test-to-full-training-readiness">59. From Unit Test to Full Training Readiness</h3>
<p>Unit tests are the first line of defense: they check whether small, isolated parts of the code—like embeddings, attention, or softmax—produce the correct outputs. But passing unit tests isn’t the same as being ready for full training. The transition from “this layer works” to “the whole system learns correctly over thousands of steps” involves additional challenges.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gap-between-unit-tests-and-training">The gap between unit tests and training</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests check correctness: for example, verifying that <code>gpt2_forward</code> produces the same logits as PyTorch on a single batch.</li>
<li>Training readiness checks robustness: making sure the model can run repeatedly for thousands of steps without crashing, diverging, or leaking memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of it like testing a car. Unit tests are like checking the brakes, headlights, and steering individually. Training readiness is taking the car on a 500-mile road trip and making sure nothing overheats, rattles loose, or fails under stress.</p>

<li><p>Validation runs Regularly measure validation loss during training. If it decreases at first and then stabilizes, that shows the model is generalizing. If it decreases too quickly and then shoots up, that suggests overfitting.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-cpu-testing">60. Limitations of CPU Testing</h3>
<p>Testing GPT-2 on CPU is invaluable for verifying correctness, but it comes with clear limits. Understanding these limitations helps you interpret the results properly and know when it’s time to move on to GPU-based experiments.</p>
<section id="speed-constraints" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="speed-constraints">Speed constraints</h4>
<p>The most obvious limitation is speed. CPUs are optimized for general-purpose tasks, not the massive parallelism that neural networks demand. A single forward and backward pass on GPT-2 124M can take seconds or even minutes on CPU, while a GPU might handle it in milliseconds. This makes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-scale training impractical: training GPT-2 124M to convergence could take weeks or months on CPU.</li>
<li>Experiment cycles slower: testing new optimizations or debugging is slowed because each run takes longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, CPU testing is best suited for small-scale sanity checks, not full training runs.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-overhead" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memory-overhead">Memory overhead</h4>
<p>CPU memory is typically more abundant than GPU VRAM, but slower. The bottleneck often isn’t “do we have enough RAM?” but “how quickly can we move data in and out of memory?” As sequence length <code>T</code> grows, the activations balloon, and cache efficiency drops. This makes even medium-sized runs sluggish.</p>
</section>
<section id="limited-realism" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limited-realism">Limited realism</h4>
<p>Although CPU runs confirm that the math is correct, they don’t always reflect the realities of GPU execution. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>CUDA kernels have different numerical characteristics (fused operations, different rounding).</li>
<li>GPU memory layouts can expose bugs that CPU arrays hide.</li>
<li>Parallel execution may create timing or synchronization issues that never appear on CPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while CPU parity with PyTorch is necessary, it isn’t sufficient. You must repeat testing once CUDA code is introduced.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuda-architecture-overview-streams-kernels">61. CUDA Architecture Overview (streams, kernels)</h3>
<p>When the CPU version of <em>llm.c</em> runs, it executes instructions one after another on your processor cores. This is fine for small models or debugging, but deep learning workloads—especially Transformers like GPT-2—demand an enormous number of floating-point operations. To handle that, <em>llm.c</em> also includes CUDA versions of the training loop that shift computation to NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p>At a high level, CUDA is NVIDIA’s programming model that lets developers write code to run directly on the GPU. Unlike CPUs, which might have a few cores optimized for general-purpose tasks, GPUs contain thousands of simpler cores designed to process large batches of data in parallel. CUDA provides the tools to organize work so that those cores can stay busy.</p>
<section id="kernels-small-programs-that-run-on-the-gpu" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kernels-small-programs-that-run-on-the-gpu">Kernels: Small Programs That Run on the GPU</h4>
<p>In CUDA, a <em>kernel</em> is a function that runs on the GPU. When you launch a kernel, you don’t call it once like a normal C function—you launch thousands of copies at the same time. Each copy handles a different piece of the data. For example, if you want to multiply two vectors of a million elements, you can launch a million GPU threads, each multiplying one pair of numbers.</p>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, kernels are used for operations that can be expressed in terms of lots of small, independent tasks. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying the GeLU activation function elementwise to a big tensor.</li>
<li>Adding residual connections across every dimension.</li>
<li>Normalizing values in LayerNorm.</li>
</ul>
<p>For bigger, structured operations like matrix multiplications (GEMMs), the CUDA code often relies on specialized libraries such as cuBLAS or cuBLASLt, which are highly tuned for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
</section>
<section id="streams-overlapping-work" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="streams-overlapping-work">Streams: Overlapping Work</h4>
<p>A GPU has the ability to handle multiple tasks at once. CUDA introduces the idea of <em>streams</em>, which are sequences of operations that run in order relative to each other, but can overlap with operations in other streams. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>While one kernel is executing, another can start transferring data between CPU and GPU.</li>
<li>Computation and communication can overlap, reducing idle time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the training loop of <em>llm.c</em>, streams let you schedule batches of work so that data preparation and model computation can proceed side by side. This is crucial for keeping the GPU saturated with useful work instead of waiting on the CPU.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-memory-hierarchy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-memory-hierarchy">The Memory Hierarchy</h4>
<p>CUDA programming is also shaped by the GPU memory hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registers: Fastest, private to each thread.</li>
<li>Shared Memory: Small chunks of memory shared among threads in a block; much faster than global memory.</li>
<li>Global Memory: Large, but slower. This is where tensors like weights, activations, and gradients usually live.</li>
<li>Host Memory (CPU RAM): Separate from GPU memory; transferring between them can be slow and should be minimized.</li>

<p>Matrix multiplication—often called GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiply)—is the beating heart of deep learning.

On the CPU, we saw this done with nested loops and mild optimizations. On the GPU, however, we need far more efficient approaches. That’s where cuBLAS and cuBLASLt come in.</p>

<section id="attention-kernels-cudnn-flashattention" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attention-kernels-cudnn-flashattention">63. Attention Kernels: cuDNN FlashAttention</h3>
<p>The attention mechanism is at the core of every Transformer. It allows the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence when producing an output. For GPT-2, this means that when generating the next token, the model doesn’t just look at the last word—it considers the entire sequence of words before it, adjusting how much each past token contributes. But attention is expensive. Naively, it scales quadratically with sequence length: for a sequence of 1024 tokens, you need to compute a 1024×1024 attention matrix. That’s more than a million entries, and each must be computed, normalized, and multiplied back into the value vectors.</p>
<p>On CPUs, we saw how this is implemented step by step: queries, keys, and values are projected with matrix multiplications, dot products between queries and keys are computed, softmax is applied, and the result is multiplied by values. On GPUs, we want to do the same thing, but much faster. That’s where cuDNN’s FlashAttention comes into play.</p>
<section id="what-is-flashattention" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-flashattention">What Is FlashAttention?</h4>
<p>FlashAttention is an algorithm that rethinks how attention is computed. Instead of materializing the full attention matrix in memory, it computes softmax and the weighted sum in a streaming fashion. This reduces memory usage and improves cache efficiency.</p>
<p>Normally, attention involves these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compute scores = Q × Kᵀ (queries times keys transpose).</li>
<li>Apply softmax over scores to get attention weights.</li>
<li>Multiply weights × V (values) to get the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem: step 1 produces a huge score matrix of size <code>(sequence_length × sequence_length)</code>. Storing and processing this full matrix becomes the bottleneck.</p>
<p>FlashAttention avoids storing the full matrix by computing attention block by block. It processes tiles of queries and keys, applies the softmax incrementally, and accumulates results directly into the output. This drastically cuts memory bandwidth requirements, which is critical for GPUs.</p>
</section>
<section id="cudnn-flashattention-in-practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cudnn-flashattention-in-practice">cuDNN FlashAttention in Practice</h4>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>’s CUDA training code, when <code>USE_CUDNN</code> is enabled, the code can take advantage of cuDNN’s implementation of FlashAttention. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The library handles the tiling and streaming automatically.</li>
<li>It can leverage Tensor Cores for mixed-precision computation (FP16/BF16 inputs with FP32 accumulation).</li>
<li>It reduces memory use, which allows training longer sequences without running out of GPU memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a developer’s point of view, enabling cuDNN FlashAttention usually involves passing specific descriptors and flags to cuDNN routines rather than writing custom kernels. Instead of manually managing loops and softmax stability tricks, you hand over the responsibility to cuDNN, which has a heavily optimized kernel.</p>

<p>The quadratic cost of attention has long been a bottleneck in scaling Transformers. With FlashAttention, the bottleneck shifts. The computation is still O(N²), but because memory is handled so much more efficiently, the GPU spends less time waiting on memory loads and more time doing actual math. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training can be faster even at the same sequence length.</li>
<li>You can push to larger sequence lengths (e.g., 2K or 4K tokens) without running out of GPU memory.</li>
<li>Energy efficiency improves because you avoid redundant reads/writes to global memory.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-why-memory-access-matters">Example: Why Memory Access Matters</h4>
<p>Let’s imagine a toy example with 4 tokens. A naive implementation might build a 4×4 attention matrix, compute softmax, and multiply by values. That’s fine for 4 tokens, but with 1024 tokens, you’d be juggling matrices of a million entries. Even if each entry is just 2 bytes (FP16), that’s megabytes of temporary storage per step. On a real GPU, constantly moving that in and out of global memory slows everything down.</p>
<p>FlashAttention says: instead of storing the whole million entries, compute them in chunks, normalize them on the fly, and immediately use them to update the output. This way, only small temporary blocks live in memory, and global memory pressure drops dramatically.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-shows-up-in-gpt-2-training">How It Shows Up in GPT-2 Training</h4>
<p>When GPT-2 processes a batch of sequences, each block of the model applies attention. In the CUDA version of <em>llm.c</em>, these attention calls can be routed through cuDNN FlashAttention. Practically, this means that the inner loop of training—the part that would otherwise grind on those giant attention matrices—becomes leaner and faster.</p>
<p>This matters even more as models grow. For GPT-2 124M (12 layers, 12 heads, 1024 sequence length), attention is already expensive. For GPT-2 1.5B or LLaMA-style models with longer contexts, FlashAttention can be the difference between feasible training and “out of memory” errors.</p>

<p>Attention is the defining operation of Transformers, but it’s also their Achilles heel. FlashAttention addresses the biggest inefficiency—memory bandwidth—without changing the model’s outputs. By using cuDNN’s optimized kernels, <em>llm.c</em> ensures it runs close to hardware peak performance while still producing correct results. For anyone learning about deep learning systems, this is a perfect example of how algorithmic innovations (streaming softmax) and hardware-level optimizations (Tensor Cores, tiling) combine to make state-of-the-art training practical.</p>

<p>Training large models like GPT-2 involves multiplying and adding enormous amounts of numbers—billions of operations in every training step. GPUs can do this very quickly, but the type of numbers you use matters a lot. Traditionally, training is done in 32-bit floating point (FP32), which gives good precision but is heavy on memory and compute. Modern GPUs offer special hardware—Tensor Cores—that run much faster when using reduced precision, such as FP16 (half-precision floating point) or BF16 (bfloat16). This technique is called mixed precision training.</p>
<section id="why-mixed-precision-helps" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-mixed-precision-helps">Why Mixed Precision Helps</h4>
<p>Using FP16 or BF16 has two main benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Speed: GPUs can perform more FP16/BF16 operations per clock cycle than FP32. For example, NVIDIA Tensor Cores are specifically designed to accelerate half-precision math, often delivering 2× or more throughput.</li>
<li>Memory: FP16/BF16 values take half the storage of FP32. That means you can fit larger batches or longer sequences into the same GPU memory, which is critical for scaling models.</li>
</ol>
<p>But reduced precision comes with a tradeoff: it’s easier for numbers to underflow (become zero) or overflow (become infinity), which can destabilize training.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="master-weights-in-fp32">Master Weights in FP32</h4>

<li>The gradients are computed in reduced precision as well.</li>

<li>The updated master weights are cast back to FP16/BF16 for the next forward pass.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loss-scaling-in-mixed-precision-training">65. Loss Scaling in Mixed Precision Training</h3>
<p>When training in mixed precision (FP16 or BF16), one of the biggest challenges is numerical underflow. Gradients can become so small that they round down to zero when represented in 16-bit format. If that happens too often, the optimizer stops receiving meaningful updates, and training can stagnate or collapse. To address this, frameworks introduce a technique called loss scaling.</p>
<section id="the-core-idea-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-core-idea-2">The Core Idea</h4>
<p>Loss scaling works by multiplying the loss value by a constant factor (called the scale factor) before starting backpropagation. Since gradients are proportional to the loss, this also multiplies all gradients by the same factor, making them larger and less likely to underflow when stored in FP16.</p>
<p>At the end of backpropagation, the gradients are divided by the same scale factor, restoring their correct values before the optimizer step.</p>
<p>Mathematically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>scaled_loss = loss × scale</code></li>
<li>Compute gradients of <code>scaled_loss</code> → produces <code>scaled_gradients</code></li>
<li><code>true_gradients = scaled_gradients ÷ scale</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The optimizer then uses <code>true_gradients</code> to update the weights.</p>
</section>
<section id="static-vs.-dynamic-scaling" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="static-vs.-dynamic-scaling">Static vs.&nbsp;Dynamic Scaling</h4>
<p>There are two common approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static scaling: Use a fixed scale factor throughout training. For example, always multiply the loss by <code>1024</code>. This is simple but risky; if the scale is too high, gradients may overflow to infinity. If it’s too low, underflow still happens.</li>
<li>Dynamic scaling: Adjust the scale factor on the fly. If overflows (NaNs or Infs) are detected, the scale factor is reduced. If training proceeds smoothly, the scale factor is gradually increased. This balances stability and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, dynamic scaling is the standard. Libraries like PyTorch’s <code>GradScaler</code> automatically handle this logic, so users don’t have to tweak values manually.</p>

<p>Training deep networks like GPT-2 involves storing a large number of activations—the intermediate outputs produced at every layer during the forward pass. These activations are needed later in the backward pass to compute gradients. The problem is that they take up a huge amount of GPU memory. For a 12-layer GPT-2 with long sequences and large batch sizes, activations can consume more memory than the model weights themselves.</p>
<section id="why-activations-matter" class="level4">

<p>Let’s say you have a batch size of 8, sequence length of 1024, hidden size of 768, and 12 layers. Each layer produces an activation tensor of shape <code>(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)</code>, or <code>8 × 1024 × 768</code>. That’s about 6.3 million numbers per layer. Multiply by 12 layers, and you have ~75 million numbers. At FP16, that’s around 150 MB per forward pass just for storing activations, and this grows with larger models.</p>

<ol type="1">

<p>A GPT-2 block has multiple steps: embedding lookup, attention, MLP, layer norm, residual connections. Normally, you’d store every output tensor. With checkpointing, you might only store the input to each block and discard the intermediate results. When backpropagation reaches that block, you rerun the forward pass locally to regenerate those results, then compute gradients.</p>
<p>This reduces memory usage almost linearly with the number of discarded activations, at the cost of roughly 30–40% more compute.</p>

<p>When training a GPT-2 model on GPU, one of the most important practical challenges is managing memory. Every tensor—the model’s parameters, gradients, optimizer state, and activations—must fit into limited GPU RAM.

<p>Training Transformers is not just about writing the forward and backward passes—it’s about planning memory carefully. Parameters, gradients, optimizer states, and activations all compete for limited GPU RAM. By understanding these categories and using techniques like mixed precision and checkpointing, you can fit bigger models or longer contexts on the same hardware. This balance between memory and compute is at the heart of scaling modern deep learning.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kernel-launch-configurations-and-occupancy">68. Kernel Launch Configurations and Occupancy</h3>
<p>When writing CUDA code for training models like GPT-2, one of the most important yet subtle factors in performance is how kernels are launched. A kernel is just a function that runs on the GPU, but the way you configure it—the number of threads, blocks, and how work is divided—can make the difference between a GPU that runs at 10% efficiency and one that’s near peak utilization.</p>
<section id="threads-blocks-and-grids" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="threads-blocks-and-grids">Threads, Blocks, and Grids</h4>
<p>CUDA organizes computation hierarchically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread: the smallest unit of execution. Each thread runs the kernel code once.</li>
<li>Block: a collection of threads that share fast, on-chip memory (called shared memory).</li>
<li>Grid: a collection of blocks. Together, the grid represents the entire kernel launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you launch a kernel, you decide:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-occupancy">What Is Occupancy?</h4>
<p>Occupancy refers to how many threads are active on a GPU relative to the maximum possible. Higher occupancy usually means the GPU is better utilized, but it’s not the only factor—memory access patterns and instruction throughput also matter.</p>
<p>Each GPU has a fixed number of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), and each SM can support only a certain number of threads and blocks at once. If your kernel launch doesn’t provide enough threads, the GPU will be underutilized. If you launch too many, they may compete for shared memory and registers, leading to inefficiency.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to add two arrays of size <code>N = 1e6</code>.</p>

<li>If you use <code>threads_per_block = 32</code>, you’ll have many tiny blocks. This wastes parallelism because modern GPUs are designed to run hundreds of threads per SM.</li>
<li>If you use <code>threads_per_block = 1024</code>, you may hit the hardware limit but run very large blocks that restrict scheduling flexibility.</li>

<li>Memory Coalescing: Do threads access memory in aligned, sequential chunks (which is fast) or scattered patterns (which is slow)?</li>
<li>Shared Memory and Registers: Each block has limited resources. If your kernel uses too much shared memory, fewer blocks can fit per SM, reducing occupancy.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuda-error-handling-and-debugging">69. CUDA Error Handling and Debugging</h3>
<p>When writing or running CUDA code, one of the most frustrating parts is that errors often don’t show up immediately. Unlike CPU code, where an invalid pointer or division by zero can crash right away, CUDA launches kernels asynchronously. This means the host code (running on the CPU) queues up GPU work and moves on, while the GPU processes it in the background. If something goes wrong inside the kernel, the error might not be visible until later—sometimes only after you try to synchronize.</p>
<section id="common-error-sources" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-error-sources">Common Error Sources</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Out-of-bounds memory access A kernel thread tries to read or write past the end of an array. This can silently produce incorrect results or crash the program.</p></li>

<li><p>Illegal instruction or unsupported hardware feature Using Tensor Cores on an older GPU, or using instructions not supported by your GPU’s compute capability, can fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of memory (OOM) Allocating more GPU memory than available causes runtime errors. Unlike CPU memory, GPUs cannot “swap” to disk.</p></li>

The main training files (<code>train_gpt2.cu</code>, <code>train_gpt2_fp32.cu</code>) rely heavily on cuBLAS and cuDNN—optimized libraries that already deliver near-peak performance.

The idea is conceptually simple: instead of giving all the training data to one GPU, you split it into smaller batches, send each GPU a piece, let them process it independently, and then combine their results.</p>
<section id="the-core-idea-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-core-idea-3">The Core Idea</h4>
<p>Imagine you have a batch of 128 sequences and 4 GPUs. In data parallelism:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU 0 sees sequences 0–31</li>
<li>GPU 1 sees sequences 32–63</li>
<li>GPU 2 sees sequences 64–95</li>
<li>GPU 3 sees sequences 96–127</li>
</ul>
<p>Each GPU runs the forward pass, computes the loss, and calculates gradients for its slice. At the end of the step, the gradients are averaged across GPUs, ensuring that all models stay synchronized. Every GPU holds a full copy of the model parameters, so they are always consistent after gradient averaging.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-llm.c-1">In <em>llm.c</em></h4>
<p>The <em>llm.c</em> repository keeps things minimal, so there isn’t a full-fledged DeepSpeed or PyTorch DDP implementation. But the same principle applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each GPU gets a copy of the GPT-2 model.</li>
<li>The batch is split across devices.</li>
<li>After the backward pass, gradients from all GPUs must be synchronized.</li>
</ul>
<p>This synchronization is usually done using NCCL all-reduce (covered in the next section), but the design remains data parallel at heart.</p>

<section id="why-data-parallelism-works" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-data-parallelism-works">Why Data Parallelism Works</h4>
<p>The forward and backward passes are embarrassingly parallel across different data samples. A token in sequence A doesn’t need to know about a token in sequence B when computing gradients. As long as all GPUs agree on parameter updates after each step, splitting the batch is perfectly valid.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-walkthrough-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-walkthrough-4">Example Walkthrough</h4>
<p>Let’s say we’re training GPT-2 on TinyStories with batch size <code>B = 32</code> and sequence length <code>T = 64</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a single GPU, the forward pass computes embeddings, attention, MLP, and loss for all 32 sequences.</li>
<li>With 2 GPUs, we set <code>B = 16</code> on each. Each GPU processes 16 sequences in parallel.</li>
<li>After backpropagation, both GPUs hold gradients for their half of the batch. Before applying the optimizer, the gradients are averaged so that the weight update is equivalent to training with the full batch of 32.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the model’s perspective, it’s as if nothing changed—it just sees gradients from the whole batch.</p>

<section id="memory-and-speed-benefits" class="level4">

<ul>
<li>Memory: Each GPU stores only the activations for its local batch. This reduces per-GPU memory use, making it possible to train with larger global batches.</li>
<li>Speed: Training steps finish faster because multiple GPUs share the work. For example, doubling the number of GPUs often cuts training time per step nearly in half, though communication overhead prevents perfect scaling.</li>

<p>Data parallelism is the workhorse of deep learning scaling. It’s conceptually easy to understand, straightforward to implement, and works well even for large models.

<p>Data parallelism splits the workload across GPUs by dividing the batch. Each GPU trains a full model replica on part of the data, then synchronizes gradients so that updates are consistent. It’s simple but powerful, forming the foundation of scaling strategies in <em>llm.c</em> and in most deep learning frameworks. Without it, training GPT-2 and larger models on modern datasets would be impractical.</p>

<section id="mpi-process-model-and-gpu-affinity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mpi-process-model-and-gpu-affinity">72. MPI Process Model and GPU Affinity</h3>
<p>When you scale training beyond a single GPU, you need a way to manage multiple processes and devices. In the <em>llm.c</em> codebase, the minimalist approach relies on MPI (Message Passing Interface), a library that has been around for decades in high-performance computing. MPI provides a simple abstraction: you launch multiple processes, each assigned a rank (an ID number), and they can communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages.</p>
<p>In distributed deep learning, MPI typically works alongside NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library). MPI handles process management—spawning workers, assigning GPUs, setting up environment variables—while NCCL handles the actual gradient synchronization.</p>
<section id="mpi-processes-and-ranks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mpi-processes-and-ranks">MPI Processes and Ranks</h4>
<p>Suppose you want to train on 4 GPUs. MPI will start 4 processes. Each process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loads the same GPT-2 model code.</li>
<li>Initializes CUDA on one GPU.</li>
<li>Reads a shard of the training data or the same dataset, depending on setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each process gets a rank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rank 0 → GPU 0</li>
<li>Rank 1 → GPU 1</li>
<li>Rank 2 → GPU 2</li>
<li>Rank 3 → GPU 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranks are important because they determine roles. For example, rank 0 often acts as the “master,” printing logs or handling checkpoints, while the others focus purely on computation.</p>
</section>
<section id="gpu-affinity" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gpu-affinity">GPU Affinity</h4>
<p>If you don’t explicitly map processes to GPUs, they can all try to use the same device. That leads to oversubscription—multiple processes fighting for one GPU while the others sit idle. To prevent this, you set GPU affinity.</p>
<p>The environment variable <code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code> is the simplest way to do this. For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb151"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb151-1"><a href="#cb151-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Run with 4 GPUs</span></span>

<p>MPI automatically assigns process 0 to GPU 0, process 1 to GPU 1, and so on. Inside the code, you can confirm this by calling <code>cudaSetDevice(rank)</code>.</p>
<p>On multi-node clusters, GPU affinity also needs to consider network topology. You want each process close to its GPU and ideally aligned with the node’s network card for faster NCCL communication.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nccl-all-reduce-for-gradient-sync">73. NCCL All-Reduce for Gradient Sync</h3>
<p>Once each GPU finishes its forward and backward pass, it has a set of gradients that reflect only its portion of the training data. To keep the model parameters consistent across all GPUs, these gradients must be synchronized. The standard way to do this in modern deep learning systems is with All-Reduce, and NVIDIA’s NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library, pronounced “Nickel”) provides the optimized implementation.</p>
<section id="what-all-reduce-does" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-all-reduce-does">What All-Reduce Does</h4>
<p>All-Reduce is a collective communication operation. Every process (GPU) starts with its own local buffer of values—here, the gradients—and the operation combines them (using a reduction, usually summation) and distributes the result back to all processes.</p>
<p>Mathematically, if GPU 0 has <code>g0</code>, GPU 1 has <code>g1</code>, GPU 2 has <code>g2</code>, and GPU 3 has <code>g3</code>, then after All-Reduce, each GPU has the same result:</p>
<pre><code>g_all = (g0 + g1 + g2 + g3) / 4</code></pre>
<p>The division by 4 is optional—it depends whether you want a sum or an average—but averaging is common for gradient updates.</p>
<p>This ensures that every GPU applies the same weight update and stays synchronized with the others.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ring All-Reduce: GPUs are arranged in a ring. Each GPU sends its data to the next while receiving from the previous, accumulating partial sums as the data flows. This scales well with many GPUs.</li>
<li>Tree All-Reduce: Organizes communication as a tree, reducing depth (latency) at the cost of bandwidth.</li>
<li>Hybrid schemes: NCCL dynamically chooses strategies depending on GPU count and topology.</li>

<p>Building a multi-GPU trainer is the gateway to scaling. A single GPU may take weeks to train a large model, but spreading the work across 4, 8, or 16 GPUs cuts the time dramatically. The simplicity of <em>llm.c</em> shows that distributed training doesn’t require a massive framework—just careful use of MPI and NCCL.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-takeaway-63">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>Multi-GPU trainers in <em>llm.c</em> are built around three pillars: MPI to manage processes, NCCL to synchronize gradients, and CUDA to run the math. Once these are in place, the training loop remains familiar, but the computation spreads across GPUs seamlessly. This design keeps the code minimal while still unlocking significant scaling power.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multi-node-bootstrapping-with-mpi">75. Multi-Node Bootstrapping with MPI</h3>
<p>So far, running across multiple GPUs on a single machine is relatively straightforward: every process talks through shared memory or high-speed interconnects like NVLink. Things become more interesting when training has to scale across multiple machines (often called “nodes”)—for example, when you want to run on 2 servers, each with 4 GPUs, to make a total of 8.</p>
<section id="the-mpi-world" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mpi-world">The MPI World</h4>
<p>MPI was designed for this. When you run:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb159"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb159-1"><a href="#cb159-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">mpirun</span> <span class="at">-np</span> 8 <span class="at">-hostfile</span> myhosts ./train_gpt2_cu</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-np 8</code> says you want 8 processes.</li>
<li><code>-hostfile myhosts</code> lists the machines (and how many processes to run on each).</li>
</ul>
<p>MPI then launches processes across nodes and assigns each one a rank. From the program’s perspective, it doesn’t matter if two ranks are on the same machine or different machines—they all see a global communicator of size 8.</p>

<p>NCCL doesn’t know how to find other machines by itself. It relies on MPI to exchange a unique NCCL ID. The typical flow is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rank 0 creates a new NCCL ID.</li>
<li>Rank 0 broadcasts the ID to all other ranks using MPI.</li>
<li>Each process calls <code>ncclCommInitRank</code> with the shared ID, total world size, and its own rank.</li>

<li><p>Firewall rules: NCCL needs open ports to connect nodes. Firewalls or strict security settings can block communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Environment variables: Variables like <code>NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME</code> (to pick the right network interface) often need to be set. For example:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="slurm-and-pmix-caveats">76. SLURM and PMIx Caveats</h3>
<p>On many research clusters or supercomputers, you don’t launch jobs manually with <code>mpirun</code> and a hostfile. Instead, you interact with a job scheduler, most commonly SLURM. SLURM takes care of allocating resources, starting processes across nodes, and enforcing quotas. While this saves you from manually managing hostfiles, it introduces its own set of details that you need to understand.</p>
<section id="slurm-basics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="slurm-basics">SLURM Basics</h4>
<p>In SLURM, you typically request GPUs and nodes using a script or command like:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb162"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb162-1"><a href="#cb162-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">salloc</span> <span class="at">-N</span> 2 <span class="at">-G</span> 8 <span class="at">--time</span><span class="op">=</span>01:00:00</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-N 2</code> asks for 2 nodes.</li>
<li><code>-G 8</code> requests 8 GPUs (across those nodes).</li>
<li><code>--time=01:00:00</code> sets a one-hour time limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the job starts, SLURM sets environment variables such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SLURM_NTASKS</code>: total number of tasks (processes).</li>
<li><code>SLURM_PROCID</code>: the rank of the current process.</li>
<li><code>SLURM_NODEID</code>: which node this process is running on.</li>
</ul>
<p>MPI implementations (OpenMPI, MPICH) and NCCL can use these to bootstrap communication automatically.</p>
</section>
<section id="pmix-integration" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pmix-integration">PMIx Integration</h4>
<p>Modern SLURM often works with PMIx (Process Management Interface for Exascale). PMIx allows MPI and other runtimes to query process information directly from SLURM without relying on older launchers. In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You might not use <code>mpirun</code> at all. Instead, SLURM provides <code>srun</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb163"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb163-1"><a href="#cb163-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">srun</span> <span class="at">-n</span> 8 ./train_gpt2_cu</span></code></pre></div><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></div>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-pitfalls-2">Common Pitfalls</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>MPI version mismatch If your cluster has multiple MPI libraries installed, you may accidentally compile with one and run with another. Always confirm that the <code>mpicc</code> and <code>mpirun</code> you’re using match the library your job is linking against.</p></li>
<li><p>Environment variable propagation NCCL relies on environment variables like <code>NCCL_DEBUG</code>, <code>NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME</code>, and <code>NCCL_IB_HCA</code>. Sometimes SLURM doesn’t forward these to all nodes unless you configure it to. Using <code>--export=ALL</code> or adding exports in your job script can fix this.</p></li>
<li><p>GPU visibility SLURM manages GPU allocation via <code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code>. Each process only “sees” the GPUs it was assigned. If your code assumes a global view of all GPUs, it may break. In <em>llm.c</em>, the mapping between rank and GPU ID needs to respect this.</p></li>
<li><p>Network fabric mismatches On big clusters, you may have multiple network fabrics (Ethernet, InfiniBand). If NCCL picks the wrong one, performance plummets. Explicitly setting <code>NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME</code> or <code>NCCL_IB_DISABLE</code> can solve this.</p></li>

<p>SLURM and PMIx streamline distributed training on large clusters, but they add another layer of complexity. The principles remain the same—MPI ranks, NCCL communicators, and CUDA kernels—but the scheduler decides how processes are placed and how environments are set up.

<p>When training on multiple GPUs, one of the most frustrating experiences is a job that simply hangs — no errors, no crashes, just frozen processes. In distributed deep learning, hangs are almost always related to synchronization mismatches. Every GPU worker is supposed to “meet up” at communication points (like gradient all-reduce), and if even one process gets lost, the whole group stalls.</p>

<li><p>Uneven Batch Sizes If the training data isn’t perfectly divisible across GPUs, one process might run out of data earlier than others. The code tries to sync gradients, but some ranks never reach that point.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Batch sizes can stay small (e.g., 4–8).</li>
<li>Memory requirements are modest — a few gigabytes of VRAM.</li>
<li>Training speed is relatively fast, so you can iterate quickly.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nccl-tuning-and-overlap-opportunities">79. NCCL Tuning and Overlap Opportunities</h3>
<p>Once your training runs extend beyond a single GPU, communication overhead becomes a central challenge. Every training step requires gradients to be exchanged among GPUs so that the optimizer updates stay synchronized. This is where NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) comes in. NCCL provides efficient implementations of collective operations like all-reduce, all-gather, and broadcast. But simply using NCCL isn’t enough: how you tune it, and how you overlap communication with computation, can make the difference between sluggish training and near-linear scaling.</p>
<section id="how-nccl-works-in-training" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-nccl-works-in-training">How NCCL Works in Training</h4>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, when multiple GPUs train together, each GPU computes its local gradients during backpropagation. At the end of the backward pass, NCCL’s all-reduce combines gradients across GPUs so that every GPU ends up with the same values. Only then can the optimizer step forward.</p>
<p>Without NCCL, you’d have to write custom point-to-point code with <code>cudaMemcpyPeer</code> or MPI, which would be both slower and harder to maintain. NCCL ensures the communication pattern is efficient for the underlying hardware — PCIe, NVLink, or InfiniBand.</p>

<section id="overlapping-communication-with-computation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overlapping-communication-with-computation">Overlapping Communication with Computation</h4>
<p>The backward pass doesn’t need to wait until all gradients are computed before starting to communicate. In fact, gradients for earlier layers can start their all-reduce while later layers are still computing gradients. This is called communication-computation overlap.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without overlap: compute gradients for all layers → run NCCL all-reduce for all gradients → update parameters.</li>
<li>With overlap: while gradients for higher layers are still being computed, start the all-reduce for earlier layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduces idle time and often leads to substantial throughput gains. Some frameworks (like PyTorch’s DistributedDataParallel) implement this automatically. In a low-level system like <em>llm.c</em>, this would require careful kernel launch ordering and stream management.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-example">Practical Example</h4>
<p>Imagine you’re training GPT-2 774M across 8 GPUs. Each backward pass produces ~3 GB of gradients. If you wait until all gradients are ready before syncing, the all-reduce might take 200 ms. If your compute step also takes 200 ms, then half of your training time is spent idle. With overlap, you can hide much of that communication inside compute time, potentially cutting step time almost in half.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-53">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>As model sizes increase, communication costs can rival or exceed computation. Without tuning, GPUs spend more time waiting for data to arrive than actually training the model. By understanding NCCL and applying overlap techniques, you unlock the ability to scale efficiently to dozens or even hundreds of GPUs.</p>

<p>Efficient distributed training is not only about having more GPUs — it’s about keeping them busy. NCCL provides the communication backbone, but how you configure and overlap its operations determines whether you get close to linear scaling or waste resources. Mastering these details transforms multi-GPU training from “just working” into truly efficient large-scale computation.</p>

<p>When running <em>llm.c</em> across multiple GPUs, errors can range from confusing hangs to cryptic NCCL messages. These problems are normal in distributed training, but they can eat up hours unless you recognize the patterns. The good news is that most errors fall into a handful of common categories, and once you learn the typical causes, they’re easier to diagnose and fix.</p>

<p>Symptom: Training starts but then freezes. No error message, no crash, just silence. Cause: Usually, one or more ranks are out of sync. This could mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different batch sizes on each rank (one rank has fewer tokens left).</li>
<li>A mismatch in collective calls — for example, one GPU calls <code>all_reduce</code> while another skips it.</li>
<li>A CUDA error in one process that prevents it from reaching synchronization. Fix:</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-devcuda-library-for-custom-kernels">81. The <code>dev/cuda</code> Library for Custom Kernels</h3>
<p>So far, most of the CUDA logic in <em>llm.c</em> has relied on NVIDIA’s optimized libraries like cuBLAS and cuDNN. These libraries are extremely powerful and efficient, but sometimes you want more control: maybe you’re experimenting with a new attention mechanism, or maybe you want to fuse multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce memory traffic. That’s where the <code>dev/cuda</code> directory comes in. It’s the playground for custom kernels.</p>
<section id="what-lives-in-devcuda" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-lives-in-devcuda">What Lives in <code>dev/cuda</code></h4>
<p>If you look at the repository structure, you’ll notice a folder named <code>dev/cuda</code>. This is not part of the minimal training path — you can train GPT-2 models without ever touching it. Instead, it contains experimental kernels that showcase how to move from simple CUDA examples toward more advanced, production-level implementations.</p>
<p>Inside, you’ll typically find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello World kernels: basic examples like elementwise addition to get familiar with CUDA.</li>
<li>Fused operations: simple prototypes for combining steps like bias addition + activation.</li>
<li>Benchmark code: small programs that measure kernel performance compared to cuBLAS/cuDNN.</li>
</ul>
<p>These files are not polished production code. They’re meant to be read, modified, and played with — like lab notebooks for CUDA development.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-custom-kernels-matter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-custom-kernels-matter">Why Custom Kernels Matter</h4>
<p>Libraries like cuBLAS are designed to cover a wide range of use cases, but they don’t always hit the sweet spot for your specific workload. Writing custom kernels allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuse operations: Instead of launching separate kernels for bias addition, activation, and dropout, you can do all three in one kernel, saving time on memory reads/writes.</li>
<li>Experiment with new algorithms: If you invent a new type of attention or normalization, you can’t rely on cuDNN — you need to implement it yourself.</li>
<li>Learn how GPUs actually work: Reading and writing custom kernels teaches you about thread blocks, memory hierarchy, and warp scheduling, all of which deepen your understanding of GPU programming.</li>
</ul>

<section id="example-a-simple-elementwise-kernel" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-a-simple-elementwise-kernel">Example: A Simple Elementwise Kernel</h4>
<p>Here’s a very small kernel from a toy example you might find in <code>dev/cuda</code>:</p>
<pre class="cuda"><code>__global__ void add_kernel(const float* a, const float* b, float* out, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i &lt; N) {
        out[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This kernel adds two arrays <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> elementwise. While trivial compared to attention mechanisms, it illustrates the GPU execution model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each thread handles one index <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>Threads are grouped into blocks, and blocks form a grid.</li>
<li>Memory access is explicit: you control exactly how <code>out</code> is written.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scaling this up to real workloads means adding more complexity — shared memory, warp shuffles, half-precision math — but the principles remain the same.</p>

<p>Training a language model is not just about having a clever model — it’s equally about the data you feed it. In <em>llm.c</em>, datasets are handled in a very lightweight way compared to frameworks like PyTorch. Instead of complicated abstractions, the project keeps things simple: tokenize your text once, save it as a <code>.bin</code> file, and then stream batches of tokens into the model.</p>
<p>The <code>dev/data/</code> directory is where this happens. It contains scripts and utilities for preparing different datasets, from tiny toy corpora like Tiny Shakespeare to larger collections like TinyStories or OpenWebText subsets. Understanding how this directory works is the key to plugging in your own datasets.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-data-pipelines-work-in-llm.c">How Data Pipelines Work in <em>llm.c</em></h4>
<p>At a high level, the pipeline follows three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download or provide raw text data. For example, <code>tiny_shakespeare.txt</code> is just a plain text file with plays concatenated.</li>
<li>Tokenize the data once using the GPT-2 tokenizer. The tokenizer converts text into integers according to <code>gpt2_tokenizer.bin</code>.</li>
<li>Write the tokens to a binary file (<code>.bin</code>). This is a flat array of integers stored as 32-bit values, which makes it fast to memory-map and stream during training.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <code>.bin</code> files exist, <code>dataloader_init</code> can open them, divide them into training and validation splits, and generate batches of shape <code>(B, T)</code> for the model.</p>

<li>Tokenization scripts — often small Python snippets that run the GPT-2 tokenizer over raw text.</li>
<li>Prebuilt <code>.bin</code> files — these are used in the quickstart so you don’t need to regenerate them yourself.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters-57">Why It Matters</h4>
<p>Optimizers control how your model learns. While architectures like GPT-2 get a lot of attention, small changes in optimization can make the difference between a model that converges smoothly and one that diverges. By adding your own optimizers, you get a clearer understanding of this often “black box” part of deep learning.</p>

<p>Training isn’t only about choosing an optimizer; the way you adjust the learning rate over time is just as important. A scheduler tells the optimizer <em>how fast to learn</em> at each step. Without a scheduler, you’d use a fixed learning rate, which often works poorly for large models. In <em>llm.c</em>, schedulers are kept intentionally simple so you can see exactly how they influence training.</p>

<p>One of the guiding principles of <em>llm.c</em> is to stay small, readable, and minimal — but that doesn’t mean you’re left without a safety net. When implementing something as mathematically dense as a transformer, how do you know your C or CUDA code is doing the right thing? The answer is to use PyTorch as a reference implementation, often called an “oracle.”</p>

<li>It’s widely used in production and research.</li>
<li>Its operators (matrix multiply, attention, layernorm, etc.) have been thoroughly tested.</li>
<li>It gives you both CPU and GPU implementations with stable numerical behavior.</li>
</ul>

<li>Feed the same inputs to both models.</li>
<li>Compare outputs — logits, losses, or gradients.</li>
<li>Allow for tiny differences due to floating point arithmetic, usually within <code>1e-5</code> to <code>1e-6</code>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Transparency: it’s easy to extract weights from PyTorch checkpoints (<code>.bin</code> files).</li>
<li>Flexibility: you can test individual layers, not just the whole model.</li>
<li>Debuggability: if something goes wrong, you can isolate which layer diverges first.</li>

<p>Deep learning models are fragile. Even a tiny mistake in normalization, masking, or gradient flow can ruin training. By anchoring your work to PyTorch, you avoid “trusting your gut” and instead rely on a battle-tested baseline.

<p>PyTorch is your map and compass when navigating the dense jungle of transformer internals. By treating it as an oracle, you can move confidently from one layer to the next, knowing that your small, hand-written code matches the behavior of a full-featured deep learning framework. This practice turns <em>llm.c</em> into more than a toy project — it becomes a faithful, verifiable reimplementation of GPT-2.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploring-beyond-gpt-2-llama-example">88. Exploring Beyond GPT-2: LLaMA Example</h3>
<p>While <em>llm.c</em> focuses on GPT-2 for clarity, the same framework can extend to newer, larger, and more modern models such as LLaMA. LLaMA, released by Meta, uses many of the same building blocks as GPT-2 — embeddings, attention layers, MLPs, normalization, and residual streams — but with tweaks that improve efficiency and scaling. Looking at LLaMA through the lens of <em>llm.c</em> helps you see how language model designs evolve while still sharing the same DNA.</p>
<section id="what-stays-the-same" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-stays-the-same">What Stays the Same</h4>
<ul>
<li>Token embeddings: both GPT-2 and LLaMA use lookup tables to turn token IDs into dense vectors.</li>
<li>Transformer blocks: the fundamental loop of attention → MLP → residuals is unchanged.</li>
<li>Autoregressive training: predict the next token given all previous ones, using causal masking.</li>

<li>LLaMA uses RMSNorm, which normalizes using only the root mean square of activations (no mean subtraction).</li>
<li>This reduces compute slightly and improves stability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Positional Encoding</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-2 has learned positional embeddings.</li>
<li>LLaMA uses Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), which rotate queries and keys in attention space to encode positions.</li>
<li>RoPE scales better to longer contexts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Vocabulary</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-2’s vocab size is 50,257.</li>
<li>LLaMA uses a different tokenizer (SentencePiece/BPE) with a larger vocabulary, closer to 32k for LLaMA-2.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Model Scale</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-2 tops out at 1.6B parameters.</li>

<p>One of the defining features of <em>llm.c</em> is its minimalism. The repository avoids the sprawling complexity of large frameworks and instead sticks to a small, readable core. This design choice isn’t an accident—it’s a philosophy. By keeping the codebase small and clean, contributors can focus on understanding the fundamentals of transformers rather than navigating thousands of lines of boilerplate.</p>

<li>Portability: A smaller codebase can be ported more easily to new environments (Go, Rust, Metal) without pulling in dozens of dependencies.</li>
<li>Learning-first design: Every line of code has a clear purpose. There are no abstractions “just in case.”</li>

<p>On CPU, training a single step may take several seconds. On a single GPU with CUDA, each step may take under 100 milliseconds. With 124M parameters, training from scratch on a dataset the size of OpenWebText still takes days, but you can reproduce key dynamics (loss curve, sample generations) on smaller datasets in hours.</p>
<p>As an example, here’s the type of log you might see:</p>
<pre><code>step 0: train loss 6.9321 (took 421.5 ms)
step 100: train loss 4.2137 (took 95.2 ms)
step 200: train loss 3.8914 (took 94.8 ms)

Once you’ve mastered this reproduction, you’re ready to push toward larger models and more complex setups. It’s the foundation on which everything else in <em>llm.c</em> builds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducing-gpt-2-355m-constraints-and-tricks">92. Reproducing GPT-2 355M (Constraints and Tricks)</h3>
<p>Once GPT-2 124M has been successfully reproduced, the next logical step is scaling up to GPT-2 355M. This version is roughly three times larger, with about 355 million parameters. It introduces new challenges that don’t appear at the smaller scale: memory pressure, training stability, and compute cost.</p>
<section id="model-configuration" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configuration">Model Configuration</h4>
<p>The 355M model still uses 1024 tokens as the maximum sequence length and the same GPT-2 tokenizer. The difference is in the depth and width of the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layers: 24 transformer blocks instead of 12</li>
<li>Hidden dimension (channels): 1024 instead of 768</li>
<li>Heads: 16 instead of 12</li>
</ul>
<p>The total parameter count rises from ~124M to ~355M. That means not just three times more math per step, but also more memory needed for parameters, gradients, and optimizer state.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-compute-challenge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-compute-challenge">The Compute Challenge</h4>
<p>With 124M, a single GPU with 8–12 GB of VRAM is enough. For 355M, you need at least 16 GB to run comfortably with sequence length 1024 and batch size of 8. On smaller GPUs, you’ll quickly hit “CUDA out of memory” errors.</p>
<p>One trick is to reduce batch size (B) or sequence length (T). For example, instead of training with <code>(B=8, T=1024)</code>, you might use <code>(B=4, T=512)</code>. This halves the memory footprint but still lets you test scaling dynamics.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use gradient accumulation: simulate a larger batch size by running multiple small steps and accumulating gradients before updating.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-stability" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-stability">Training Stability</h4>
<p>Larger models are more sensitive to hyperparameters. The AdamW optimizer still works, but the learning rate schedule becomes more important. Many practitioners use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning rate: ~3e-4 peak</li>
<li>Warmup steps: a few thousand</li>
<li>Cosine decay: to taper the learning rate gradually</li>
</ul>
<p>If you skip warmup, the larger model may diverge early (loss exploding instead of decreasing).</p>

<p>The 774M parameter version of GPT-2 is often called “GPT-2 Medium.” This is the point where training transitions from a personal experiment to a small-scale research project. It’s about six times larger than the 124M baseline, and roughly twice the size of 355M. Running it requires careful planning of hardware, memory, and software tricks.</p>
<section id="model-configuration-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configuration-1">Model Configuration</h4>
<p>For 774M, the architecture expands again:</p>
<ul>

<li>Hidden size (channels): 1280</li>
<li>Attention heads: 20</li>
<li>Maximum sequence length: 1024 (unchanged)</li>
</ul>
<p>This jump in size increases both the parameter storage and the number of activations that must be kept during training. Optimizer states (AdamW’s <em>m</em> and <em>v</em> vectors) alone consume several gigabytes.</p>

<p>The largest GPT-2 model, with 1.6 billion parameters, represents the upper bound of the original GPT-2 family. Training this model from scratch is not something you can casually attempt on a single workstation. It demands cluster-scale resources, distributed training software, and careful tuning to keep everything stable. In this section, we’ll walk through what makes the 1.6B model special, what infrastructure is required, and how a full reproduction might look.</p>
<section id="model-configuration-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-configuration-2">Model Configuration</h4>
<p>The jump from 774M to 1.6B doubles the parameter count and makes the network both deeper and wider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layers (transformer blocks): 48</li>
<li>Hidden size (channels): 1600</li>
<li>Attention heads: 25</li>
<li>Sequence length: still 1024</li>
</ul>
<p>With these dimensions, every forward and backward pass requires massive amounts of memory and compute. Just storing the parameters in FP32 takes around 6.4 GB. Once you add gradients, optimizer states (AdamW’s <em>m</em> and <em>v</em>), and activations, the memory footprint easily exceeds 100 GB.</p>
</section>
<section id="hardware-setup" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hardware-setup">Hardware Setup</h4>
<p>To reproduce this model realistically, you need access to high-end accelerators such as NVIDIA A100s or H100s. A common baseline is 8 GPUs with 80 GB each. With this setup, it is possible to train GPT-2 1.6B in under 24 hours, assuming efficient utilization.</p>
<p>Without multi-GPU, training is impractical. Even if you could somehow fit the model on one GPU, the runtime would be weeks or months.</p>

<p>The main strategy is data parallelism: each GPU processes a different mini-batch of data, and gradients are averaged across all devices with NCCL all-reduce. The code paths in <em>llm.c</em> support this via MPI integration, so you can scale from single-GPU to multi-node setups.</p>
<p>The training loop looks nearly identical to smaller models, but behind the scenes, every parameter update is coordinated across devices.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-dynamics-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-dynamics-1">Training Dynamics</h4>
<p>The loss curve for 1.6B smooths out compared to smaller models. With enough data, the model continues to improve where 774M starts to plateau. This was one of the key insights from the original GPT-2 paper: scaling laws hold, and performance improves predictably with size, data, and compute.</p>
<p>Logs from a distributed run might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[rank 0] step 0: train loss 8.5029 (took 312.6 ms)

<p>Not everyone has access to powerful GPUs or large compute clusters. One of the strengths of <em>llm.c</em> is that it provides a clean, minimal CPU-only path that lets you run real experiments—even if they are small and slow. A practical way to explore this is by fine-tuning GPT-2 on a small dataset like Tiny Shakespeare, which has only about 1 MB of text.</p>
<section id="why-tiny-shakespeare" class="level4">

<p>These numbers show why scaling matters. The larger models don’t just need more compute per step—they also need more data to reach their potential. That means the total cost balloons unless you have a cluster of top-tier GPUs.</p>

<p>If you run these experiments on cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure, costs can add up quickly. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An NVIDIA A100 40GB instance costs around $2–3 per hour (spot pricing can be cheaper).</li>
<li>Training GPT-2 124M for a week might cost $500–1,000.</li>
<li>Training GPT-2 1.6B for 24 hours on 8× H100s might cost $5,000–10,000, depending on the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why many researchers test code paths on small datasets and small models first, then only scale up when absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hyperparameter-sweeps-sweep.sh">97. Hyperparameter Sweeps (<code>sweep.sh</code>)</h3>
<p>Getting a model like GPT-2 to train well isn’t just about writing the code or having enough compute—it’s also about finding the right hyperparameters. These include the learning rate, batch size, weight decay, dropout rate, and scheduler configuration. A setting that works well for one dataset or model size might completely fail for another. That’s where hyperparameter sweeps come in: systematically trying different configurations to see which ones give the best results.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-sweep.sh" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-sweep.sh">The Role of <code>sweep.sh</code></h4>
<p>In <em>llm.c</em>, there’s a simple shell script called <code>sweep.sh</code> designed to automate hyperparameter testing. It’s not a complex experiment management system like Ray Tune or Optuna; instead, it’s lightweight, transparent, and easy to adapt. The script usually looks like a loop over different learning rates or batch sizes, running the training executable with each setting, and logging the output.</p>
<p>A very simplified version might look like this:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb187"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb187-1"><a href="#cb187-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span></span>

<p>This way, you can launch multiple experiments with a single command and later compare validation losses to decide which hyperparameters are best.</p>

<section id="why-sweeps-are-important" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-sweeps-are-important">Why Sweeps Are Important</h4>
<p>Training a transformer is highly sensitive to hyperparameters. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the learning rate is too high, loss might explode.</li>
<li>If it’s too low, training will be painfully slow.</li>
<li>Too much weight decay can hurt performance, while too little can cause overfitting.</li>
<li>The number of warmup steps can make the difference between stable convergence and failure in the first few hundred iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of guessing, sweeps let you see patterns. For instance, you might discover that <code>3e-4</code> is optimal for GPT-2 124M, but GPT-2 355M prefers <code>2e-4</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="validating-evaluation-and-loss-curves">98. Validating Evaluation and Loss Curves</h3>
<p>Training logs—loss values printed after each step—are just numbers. To really understand whether your model is learning, you need to validate those numbers, plot them, and compare them across runs. This process of analyzing evaluation and loss curves is one of the most important skills in machine learning. It’s how you know whether your model is converging, overfitting, or failing entirely.</p>
<section id="training-loss-vs.-validation-loss" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-loss-vs.-validation-loss">Training Loss vs.&nbsp;Validation Loss</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of loss curves to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training loss: computed on the batches the model actually sees during training.</li>
<li>Validation loss: computed on a held-out dataset (like <code>*_val.bin</code> in <em>llm.c</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Training loss almost always goes down steadily. Validation loss is the real test: if it decreases alongside training loss, the model is learning useful patterns. If it stalls or increases while training loss keeps dropping, the model is overfitting.</p>

<li>Late phase: Training loss may keep decreasing, but validation loss stabilizes or begins to rise. That’s the point of overfitting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CUDA path in <em>llm.c</em> already uses cuBLAS and cuDNN, NVIDIA’s high-performance math libraries, to handle the heavy lifting of matrix multiplications and attention operations. These libraries are battle-tested and extremely fast, but they also act as a “black box”: you call into them, they do the work, and you get results without seeing what’s inside. While this is convenient, it limits flexibility and makes it harder to experiment with novel optimizations.</p>
<p>That’s why one of the most exciting areas of future work is building a lightweight custom kernel library for <em>llm.c</em>. This would mean replacing parts of cuDNN with hand-written CUDA kernels for operations like attention, normalization, and activation functions.</p>

<li>Flexibility: You can experiment with new ideas (e.g., alternative attention mechanisms, sparsity tricks) without waiting for cuDNN support.</li>
<li>Portability: cuDNN is NVIDIA-specific. A custom kernel library could make it easier to port <em>llm.c</em> to other backends, like AMD GPUs (HIP) or even Metal for Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Performance Tuning: For small to medium models, hand-tuned kernels can sometimes outperform generic library calls because they’re tailored to the workload.</li>

<li>Matrix multiplication (the workhorse of transformers) using tiling and shared memory.</li>
<li>Softmax kernels with numerical stability built in.</li>
<li>LayerNorm kernels for both forward and backward passes.</li>
<li>Attention kernels that integrate matmul + masking + softmax in one fused operation.</li>
<li>Activation functions like GELU or ReLU in fused forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a very simplified CUDA kernel for vector addition might look like this:</p>
<pre class="cuda"><code>__global__ void vec_add(float* a, float* b, float* c, int N) {

    if (i &lt; N) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];

<ol type="1">
<li>Clone the <em>llm.c</em> repository and explore open issues. Can you answer one for someone else?</li>
<li>Run a training experiment and share your loss curve in GitHub Discussions.</li>
<li>Contribute a small improvement (like a new dataset script) as a pull request.</li>
<li>Create your own “learning log” to track experiments, much like a public notebook.</li>
